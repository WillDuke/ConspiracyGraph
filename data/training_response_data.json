It is usually considered to be part of the Apocalyptic literature. Late 1st century CE is the dating often preferred. The text has been preserved in full only in Slavonic, but in 2009 it was announced that Coptic fragments of the book had been identified. Greek is indicated as the language behind the Slavonic version. It is not regarded as scripture by Jews or any Christian group. It was rediscovered and published at the end of 19th century.\n\nMost scholars consider 2 Enoch to be composed by an unknown Jewish sectarian group, while some authors think it is a 1st-century Christian text. Very few scholars consider it a later Christian work. This article discusses 2 Enoch. It is distinct from the Book of Enoch, known as 1 Enoch. There is also an unrelated 3 Enoch. The numbering of these texts has been applied by scholars to distinguish the texts from one another.\n\nManuscript Tradition\n2 Enoch has survived in more than twenty Slavonic manuscripts and fragments dated from 14th to 18th centuries CE. These Slavonic materials did not circulate independently but were included in collections that often rearranged, abbreviated, or expanded them. Typically, Jewish pseudepigraphical texts in Slavic milieux were transmitted as part of larger historiographical, moral, and liturgical codexes and compendiums where ideologically marginal and mainstream materials were mixed with each other.\n\n2 Enoch exists in longer and shorter recensions. The first editors considered original the longer version, while since 1921 Schmidt and many authors challenged this theory considering more ancient the shorter recension. Vaillant in 1952 showed that the additional parts found only in the longer version use more recent Slavonic terms. Other scholars suggest that both of them preserve original material and the existence of three or even four recensions.\n\nTwo different ways to numbering verses and chapters are used for 2 Enoch: the more widely accepted is Popov's one in 73 chapters, while De Santos Otero proposed a division in 24 chapters.\n\nThe best family of manuscripts are copies of the compilation of rearranged materials from chs. 40\u201365 from a 14th-century judicial codex \"The Just Balance\" (\"Merilo Pravednoe\"). The main manuscripts of the longer version are R, J and P. The main manuscripts of the shorter version are U, B, V, N. See also references.\n\nMost scholars believe that the Slavonic version was translated from one or more Greek lost versions, since the text attests to some traditions that make sense only in the Greek language, for example a tradition found in 2 Enoch 30 that derives Adam\u2019s name from the Greek designations of the four corners of the earth. The Semitisms, such as the words Ophanim, Raqia Arabot, and others found in various parts of the text, point to the possibility of the Semitic original behind the Greek version.\n\nIn 2009, four fragments from chapters 36-42 in Coptic have been identified.

Sutton concluded that this was all part of the economic power elites' \"long-range program of nurturing collectivism\" and fostering \"corporate socialism\" in order to ensure \"monopoly acquisition of wealth\", because it \"would fade away if it were exposed to the activity of a free market\". In his view, the only solution to prevent such abuse in the future was that \"a majority of individuals declares or acts as if it wants nothing from government, declares it will look after its own welfare and interests\", or specifically that \"a majority finds the moral courage and the internal fortitude to reject the something-for-nothing con game and replace it by voluntary associations, voluntary communes, or local rule and decentralized societies\". In Sutton's own words he was \"persecuted but never prosecuted\" for his research and subsequent publication of his findings.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Sutton used a combination of public-domain information on Skull and Bones, and previously unreleased documents sent to him by Charlotte Iserbyt, whose father was in the Order to infer that it played an important role in coordinating the political and economic relationships underlying the historical events he wrote of in his previous works. He published his findings as America's Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull and Bones -- which, according to Sutton, was his most important work.\n\n~study: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_C._Sutton & http://AntonySutton.com\n\n~Skull & Bones Opium Wars Nazis Wall Street NWO Banksters 'War on Drugs' BS: http://whynotnews.eu/?p=619", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J3nDbJooPu0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J3nDbJooPu0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J3nDbJooPu0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J3nDbJooPu0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "infopowerment", "tags": ["Antony C.

In his view, the only solution to prevent such abuse in the future was that \"a majority of individuals declares or acts as if it wants nothing from government, declares it will look after its own welfare and interests\", or specifically that \"a majority finds the moral courage and the internal fortitude to reject the something-for-nothing con game and replace it by voluntary associations, voluntary communes, or local rule and decentralized societies\". In Sutton's own words he was \"persecuted but never prosecuted\" for his research and subsequent publication of his findings.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Sutton used a combination of public-domain information on Skull and Bones, and previously unreleased documents sent to him by Charlotte Iserbyt, whose father was in the Order to infer that it played an important role in coordinating the political and economic relationships underlying the historical events he wrote of in his previous works. He published his findings as America's Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull and Bones -- which, according to Sutton, was his most important work.\n\n~study: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_C._Sutton & http://AntonySutton.com\n\n~Skull & Bones Opium Wars Nazis Wall Street NWO Banksters 'War on Drugs' BS: http://whynotnews.eu/?p=619"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT40M", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "25809", "likeCount": "293", "dislikeCount": "11", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "44"}}], "pageInfo": {"totalResults": 45, "resultsPerPage": 45}}, "Query 1": {"kind": "youtube#videoListResponse", "etag": "EifwS62R0Oz38G9TXpvlzUKP3FE", "items": [{"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "jM1S0ksUTO2haPCi5uDVzG6irMA", "id": "TMtzFXtZgb0", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-01-09T19:57:46Z", "channelId": "UCJu7kC1V7vsycH4fV6Gjf9w", "title": "Prepare to Flee The Cities!

And it's true about the climate. The climate has been constantly changing since the earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nFor example, in just the past 2000 years, we have seen the Roman Warm Period, when it was warmer than today...Then came the cooler Dark Ages... Followed by the Medieval Warm period, when it was at least as warm as today... Then we had the Little Ice Age -- that drove the Vikings out of Greenland. And, most recently, a gradual 300-year warming to the present day. That's a lot of changes. And, of course, not one of them was caused by humans.\n\nDuring the past 400,000 years there have been four major periods of glaciation -- meaning that vast sheets of ice covered a good part of the globe -- interrupted by brief interglacial periods. We are in one of those periods right now. This is all part of the Pleistocene Ice Age which began in earnest two and a half million years ago. It's still going on, which means that we are still living in an ice age. That's the reason there's so much ice at the poles. Thirty million years ago the earth had no ice on it at all.  \n\nSo, then, what about carbon dioxide, the great villain of the Global Warming alarmists? Where does that fit in to this picture? Not as neatly as you might think.\n\nTemperatures and carbon dioxide levels do not show a strong correlation. In fact, over very long time spans -- periods of hundreds of millions of years -- they are often completely out of sync with each other. \n\nOver and over again, within virtually any time frame, we find the climate changing -- for reasons we do not fully understand. But we do know there are many more factors in play than simply the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere -- factors such as the shape and size of the earth's elliptical orbit around the sun, activity from the sun, and the amount of wobble or tilt in the earth's axis, among many others. Even the relatively short 300-year period from the peak of the Little Ice Age to the present has not been steady. The latest trend has been a warming one, but it began nearly a century before there were significant carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. And, there has been no significant warming trend in the 21st century. Contrary to media headlines, the trend over the past couple of decades has been essentially flat. \n\nMeanwhile human-caused CO2 emissions are higher than ever. About 25 percent of all the CO2 emissions from human sources have occurred during this period of no net warming.\n\nSo, what are we in for next? Will the temperature resume an upward trend? Will it remain flat for a lengthy period? Or, will it begin to drop? No one knows. Not even the biggest, fastest computers. \n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/what-they-havent-told-you-about-climate-change", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RkdbSxyXftc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RkdbSxyXftc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RkdbSxyXftc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RkdbSxyXftc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "PragerU", "tags": ["Dennis Prager", "Prager University", "Prager", "PragerU", "Patrick Moore", "Greenpeace", "Climate Change", "Global Warming", "Environmentalism", "Green", "Going Green", "Carbon Emissions", "Carbon Dioxide", "Ice Age", "Arctic Ice Caps"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "What They Haven't Told You about Climate Change", "description": "Since time immemorial, our climate has been and will always be changing.

I\u2019ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of \u201cglobal warming\u201d has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let\u2019s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called\u2014\u201cclimate change.\u201d \n\nThere are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and the media. \n\nGroup one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation\u2019s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man\u2019s burning of fossil fuels\u2014oil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. \n\nGroup two is made up of scientists who don\u2019t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We\u2019re usually referred to as skeptics. \n\nWe note that there are many reasons why the climate changes\u2014the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor.  \n\nBut actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement:\n\n1) The climate is always changing. \n\n2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming.\n\n3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. \n\n4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960\u2019s have man\u2019s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. \n\n5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC acknowledged in its own 2007 report that \u201cThe long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/climate-change-what-do-scientists-say", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OwqIy8Ikv-c/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OwqIy8Ikv-c/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OwqIy8Ikv-c/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OwqIy8Ikv-c/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OwqIy8Ikv-c/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "PragerU", "tags": ["Dennis Prager", "PragerU", "Prager University", "Richard Lindzen", "MIT", "Cato Institute", "global warming", "climate change", "nasa", "ipcc", "Kyoto", "al gore", "an inconvenient truth", "climatologists", "climate", "united nations", "polar bears", "ice caps", "carbon dioxide", "CO2", "carbon emissions", "carbon dioxide emissions", "CO2 emissions", "cap and trade"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Climate Change: What Do Scientists Say?", "description": "Climate change is an urgent topic of discussion among politicians, journalists and celebrities...but what do scientists say about climate change?

This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. \n\nGroup two is made up of scientists who don\u2019t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We\u2019re usually referred to as skeptics. \n\nWe note that there are many reasons why the climate changes\u2014the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor.  \n\nBut actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement:\n\n1) The climate is always changing. \n\n2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming.\n\n3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. \n\n4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960\u2019s have man\u2019s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. \n\n5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC acknowledged in its own 2007 report that \u201cThe long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.\u201d\n\nFor the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/climate-change-what-do-scientists-say"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT5M5S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "6009636", "likeCount": "55550", "dislikeCount": "18488", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "14637"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "4Puhqxsypm2YRGIe5hViFtcLigc", "id": "ZDK1aCqqZkQ", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-05-02T02:07:48Z", "channelId": "UCIveFvW-ARp_B_RckhweNJw", "title": "ACTUAL SCIENTIST: \"Climate Change is a Scam!\"", "description": "In a very special #LwC, for one full hour, we sat down with Dr. Patrick Moore, PHD in Ecology and founder of Greenpeace, and dissected the scam that is modern \"climate change\".\n\nTake media back and join the Mug Club: http://louderwithcrowder.com/mugclub\n\nUse promo codes \"student\" \"veteran\" \"military\" to get daily access for $69/year!\n\nShop the official #LWC store: http://louderwithcrowdershop.com\n\nMore at http://louderwithcrowder.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/scrowder\nLike me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/stevencrowde...\nFollow me on Vine: https://vine.co/u/1136892885917368320\n\nCheck out more of my videos!\n\nCrowder CRASHES Feminist #DayWithoutAWoman Insanity! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Gcmnmz5S0\n\nCrowder Crashes a Feminist Film Festival in Underwear!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWJT0egzAy0\n\nCenk Uygur #SXSW Panel CRASHED by Crowder...

This simulation also includes news reports that were fabricated just for this exercise, please keep that in mind because they are eerily similar to reports we are currently seeing regarding this real world coronavirus outbreak.\n\nLinks:\n\nEvent 201\nhttp://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/players/index.html \n\nCenter for health security (Videos)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/biosecuritycntr/videos \n\nLeading US health experts predicted coronavirus could kill 65million people in a year - in chilling warning three months BEFORE the outbreak in China\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7925475/US-health-experts-predicted-coronavirus-kill-65million-people-year-THREE-months-ago.html \n\nThe Real Umbrella Corp: Wuhan Ultra Biohazard Lab Was Studying \"The World's Most Dangerous Pathogens\" \nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/economics/real-umbrella-corp-wuhan-ultra-biohazard-lab-was-studying-worlds-most-dangerous-pathogens \n\n56 Million Chinese On Lockdown As Virus Spreads To Australia, Malaysia \nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/56-million-chinese-lockdown-virus-spreads-australia-malaysia \n\nChina Suddenly Increases Death Toll By Over 60% As Virus Jumps To Europe \nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/please-help-us-supply-shortages-rock-wuhan-outbreak-overwhelms-chinese-healthcare \n\nWith Wuhan virus genetic code in hand, scientists begin work on a vaccine \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-vaccines/with-wuhan-virus-genetic-code-in-hand-scientists-begin-work-on-a-vaccine-idUSKBN1ZN2J8 \n\nChina built a lab to study SARS and Ebola in Wuhan - and US biosafety experts warned in 2017 that a virus could 'escape' the facility that's become key in fighting the outbreak \nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7922379/Chinas-lab-studying-SARS-Ebola-Wuhan-outbreaks-center.html \n\nBILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION & OTHERS PREDICTED UP TO 65 MILLION DEATHS VIA CORONAVIRUS \u2013 IN SIMULATION RAN 3 MONTHS AGO! \nhttps://www.infowars.com/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-others-predicted-up-to-65-million-deaths-via-coronavirus-in-simulation-ran-3-months-ago/"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT18M46S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "375631", "likeCount": "4773", "dislikeCount": "198", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1078"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "sjr0sLXIhQoQbmrye4QUscLU4uA", "id": "tR_6dibpDfo", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-11-25T18:00:05Z", "channelId": "UCqnbDFdCpuN8CMEg0VuEBqA", "title": "Operation InfeKtion: How Russia Perfected the Art of War | NYT Opinion", "description": "Russia\u2019s meddling in the United States\u2019 elections is not a hoax.

It's assuming that there's enormous amounts capital flight going on. \nYes. \nAnd it's not showing up in the currency market. \nThe one that shows illicit capital. \nThat's right. \nYeah. \nThe diamonds obviously corroborates it. \nYes. And then we'll show you also, one of the things that when you think about how China operates, when you understand that they've now gone to current account negativity for the first time in the first half of 2018, what is important to China going forward? It's capital flows. \nAnd so we put together this chart from SAFE and CEIC's database. When you look at the green bars there, the green bars are the current account building that reserve balance that enables China to just keep printing money on the other side of their balance sheet, running their domestic economy they want to do. \nThat turned negative in the first half of 2018. So you see the green bars went negative. The blue bars here are quote, \"net errors and omissions,\" which is Chinese for illicit capital flows. So the only thing holding China up right now-- \nThis hasn't changed trend. We still think that this is negative now, going into 2019? \nWell, I'll say that-- think about what happened in December. Crude oil dropped from $75 a barrel to, what did it hit, like $43 a barrel? \nYep. \nThat's one of China's biggest imports, is crude oil. So that will give them a brief reprieve on the current account side of things. But again, the question with that, is that a secular or is that a cyclical phenomenon? \nThat's right. \nThis is key to understand. You see you see the dotted line? \nYeah. \nThat's volume of crude importation by China, using the right y-axis. And this is the dollar value of imports. So back in the end of 2014, early 2015, when crude collapsed from 100 to 30, they got a massive reprieve in their current account. But if you look at the volume, does that line look like equals y equals mx plus b?

Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, which were, in part, supported by the Central Intelligence Agency, provided grey propaganda in news and entertainment programs to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union respectively. The Soviet Union's official government station, Radio Moscow, broadcast white propaganda, while Radio Peace and Freedom broadcast grey propaganda. Both sides also broadcast black propaganda programs in periods of special crises.\n\nIn 1948, the United Kingdom's Foreign Office created the IRD (Information Research Department), which took over from wartime and slightly post-war departments such as the Ministry of Information and dispensed propaganda via various media such as the BBC and publishing.\n\nThe ideological and border dispute between the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China resulted in a number of cross-border operations. One technique developed during this period was the \"backwards transmission,\" in which the radio program was recorded and played backwards over the air. (This was done so that messages meant to be received by the other government could be heard, while the average listener could not understand the content of the program.)\n\nWhen describing life in capitalist countries, in the US in particular, propaganda focused on social issues such as poverty and anti-union action by the government. Workers in capitalist countries were portrayed as \"ideologically close\". Propaganda claimed rich people from the US derived their income from weapons manufacturing, and claimed that there was substantial racism or neo-fascism in the US.\n\nWhen describing life in Communist countries, western propaganda sought to depict an image of a citizenry held captive by governments that brainwash them. The West also created a fear of the East, by depicting an aggressive Soviet Union. In the Americas, Cuba served as a major source and a target of propaganda from both black and white stations operated by the CIA and Cuban exile groups. Radio Habana Cuba, in turn, broadcast original programming, relayed Radio Moscow, and broadcast The Voice of Vietnam as well as alleged confessions from the crew of the USS Pueblo.\n\nGeorge Orwell's novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are virtual textbooks on the use of propaganda. Though not set in the Soviet Union, these books are about totalitarian regimes that constantly corrupt language for political purposes. These novels were, ironically, used for explicit propaganda. The CIA, for example, secretly commissioned an animated film adaptation of Animal Farm in the 1950s with small changes to the original story to suit its own needs.\n\nThe United States and Iraq both employed propaganda during the Iraq War. The United States established campaigns towards the American people on the justifications of the war while using similar tactics to bring down Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq.\n\nThe extent to which the US government was guilty of propaganda aimed at its own people is a matter of discussion. The book Selling Intervention & War by Jon Western argued that president Bush was \"selling the war\" to the public.\n\nPresident George W. Bush gave a talk at the Athena Performing Arts Center at Greece Athena Middle and High School Tuesday, May 24, 2005 in Rochester, NY. About half way through the event Bush said, \"See in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda.\"\n\nPeople had their initial reactions to the War on Terror, but with more biased and persuading information, Iraq as a whole has been negatively targeted. America's goal was to remove Saddam Hussein's power in Iraq with allegations of possible weapons of mass destruction related to Osama Bin Laden.

In fact, this word only came into existence around circa 1841 AD when biologist and paleontologist, Sir Richard Owen, coined the term \"Dinosauria\" in 1841 \u2014 deriving from two Greek words: \"deinos,\" which means \"terrible, powerful, wondrous,\" and \"sauros,\" which means \"lizard.\" In today's English, this would translate as \"DRAGON.\"\n\nIn the Hebrew, the word \"Dragon\" (or \"Dinosaur\") is H8577 \u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df \"Tannin,\" which means \"serpent, dragon, sea monster.\" This word is also mentioned in 27 places throughout Scripture \u2014 most notably in Tahalliym/Psalms 91:13 (\"The young lion and the 'DRAGON' shalt thou trample under feet\" ~ KJV). \n\nHistory also proves the existence of \"Dinosaurs\" (or \"Dragons\") long before now. In the Chinese culture, \"Dragon\" is one of the twelve Chinese years. You can also see ancient fossils, carvings, sculptures, pictures, and hieroglyphics of what appear to be \"Dinosaurs\" embedded in Egyptian, Sumerian, Indian, Peruvian, Cambodian, and even the Congolese culture (And More!) This alone, contrary to false evolutionary belief, PROVES that \"Dinosaurs\" are only a few THOUSAND years old (which AGREES and LINES UP WITH Scripture), and NOT millions and millions of years old.\n\nBut are \"Dinosaurs\" still roaming the earth TODAY?!?!\n\nYOU BET!!!!!!!\n\nBecause there have been MANY \"Dinosaur\" sightings throughout recent history. \n\nIn fact, the most notable come from the Mokele-Mbembe found in the Likouala Swamp Region, Congo. There have also been reports of pterosaurs in Papua New Guinea (See \"Ropens\" Link Below).

In fact, this word only came into existence around circa 1841 AD when biologist and paleontologist, Sir Richard Owen, coined the term \"Dinosauria\" in 1841 \u2014 deriving from two Greek words: \"deinos,\" which means \"terrible, powerful, wondrous,\" and \"sauros,\" which means \"lizard.\" In today's English, this would translate as \"DRAGON.\"\n\nIn the Hebrew, the word \"Dragon\" (or \"Dinosaur\") is H8577 \u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df \"Tannin,\" which means \"serpent, dragon, sea monster.\" This word is also mentioned in 27 places throughout Scripture \u2014 most notably in Tahalliym/Psalms 91:13 (\"The young lion and the 'DRAGON' shalt thou trample under feet\" ~ KJV). \n\nHistory also proves the existence of \"Dinosaurs\" (or \"Dragons\") long before now. In the Chinese culture, \"Dragon\" is one of the twelve Chinese years. You can also see ancient fossils, carvings, sculptures, pictures, and hieroglyphics of what appear to be \"Dinosaurs\" embedded in Egyptian, Sumerian, Indian, Peruvian, Cambodian, and even the Congolese culture (And More!) This alone, contrary to false evolutionary belief, PROVES that \"Dinosaurs\" are only a few THOUSAND years old (which AGREES and LINES UP WITH Scripture), and NOT millions and millions of years old.\n\nBut are \"Dinosaurs\" still roaming the earth TODAY?!?!\n\nYOU BET!!!!!!!\n\nBecause there have been MANY \"Dinosaur\" sightings throughout recent history. \n\nIn fact, the most notable come from the Mokele-Mbembe found in the Likouala Swamp Region, Congo. There have also been reports of pterosaurs in Papua New Guinea (See \"Ropens\" Link Below). Not to mention \"famous\" reports and sightings, including \"Nessie\" and the \"Loch Ness Monster.\" \n\nSince this is TRUE, then why are they trying to hide all this from us?!\n\nWho are the \"Dinosaurs\" REALLY, and where do they REALLY come from?! \n\nCould there be an even BIGGER, More Nefarious Agenda behind all this?!\n\nAnd could all this relate to the New World Order/Coming Deceptions That Are EVEN At The Door?!\n\nTHE TRUTH REVEALED!!!!!!!\n\nREMEMBER THE DAYS OF NOAH!

Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul."}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT4H11M3S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {"ytRating": "ytAgeRestricted"}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "90954", "likeCount": "1226", "dislikeCount": "119", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "200"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "o-WSfb4EWBh-EWfB8Qn1TJGK8Cc", "id": "srqdLWwTvKQ", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-01-04T05:04:54Z", "channelId": "UCOVfjynWebmzBCxrJVeHXqw", "title": "Untold Truth About African Americans - You Are Not From Africa Nor Are You An African", "description": "SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL HERE: \n(Thumbs up this video!) \nhttp://youtube.com/c/DaneCalloway\n\nHELP SUPPORT MY CHANNEL & CONTENT HERE: \n(Contribute to keep this ship sailing & earn rewards!) \nhttp://patreon.com/danecalloway\n\nDONATE TO ME DIRECTING HERE: \n(Secure & safe one-time user friendly method!) \nhttp://paypal.me/danecalloway\n\nCHECK OUT MY WEBSITE HERE:\nhttp://imjustheretomakeyouthink.com\n\nORDER #IJHTMYT MERCHANDISE HERE: \n https://imjustheretomakeyouthink.com/merch/\n\n** USEFUL INFORMATION **\n\n\ud83d\udcccHow To Trace Your Family\u2019s Genealogical Background: \nhttps://imjustheretomakeyouthink.com/books/\n\n\ud83d\udcccInfo On Establishing Your Nationality: \nhttps://goo.gl/9Ap6hh \n\n\ud83d\udcccHow To Raise Your Credit Score: \nhttps://goo.gl/6bQUWM \n\n\u2022\u2022 FOLLOW ME ON MY SOCIAL SITES \u2022\u2022\n\n\ud83d\udcceInstagram: https://goo.gl/5s9aTW\n\ud83d\udcceFacebook: http://goo.gl/AcoQ7J\n\ud83d\udcceTwitter: https://goo.gl/8MPKws\n\n#ImJustHereToMakeYouThink\n\nAll music is licensed under a \u2018Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

These reports date from before the North Pole was turned into a public spectacle (via the \"race for the pole\" in 1907-10), a controlled area (encircled by the DEW line in Canada, Russia and every landmass between, tightly controlled by the U.N and international treaties like the 'North Pole Treaty\") and a T.V meme (every Nat Geo/etc report you've ever seen on the pole is a farce) by the Royal Geographic Society, the society at the center of each fake polar exploration since at least the mid 1880's. These ancient reports are more likely to describe the real physical attributes of Earth at the North Pole.\nNicholas Of Lynne, Christopher Columbus, Humboldt, Cabot, Mercator, John Dee, Strabo, Pliny, Lenormant, Dicuile, Cnoynen, Hakluyt,  the Ptolemy 1508, Ruysch and many more of the most famous, heavyweights of exploration, map-making (cartography) and history... are included in this book. The Inventio Fortunatae, and the Gestii Arthurii tell us all about this amazing discovery, and part of one of the greatest cover-ups ever... the true nature of the north pole. In these pages they describe the ultimate piece of military intelligence on the plane... first-hand, accurate, reliable accounts & detailed measurements of Mt. Meru, the black magnetic lodestone at the center of the earth, around which the sun, moon and stars rotate. They detail the conditions of the Septentrional Isles, Thule, the inflowing rivers and channels, the whirlepoole descending into the bowels of the earth (which may play a role in tides), the mountains, fjords, habitations and vegetation of the lost land beyond the north, aka, Shambala, Arya-Veda, Asgarde, the Shinbat Bridge, the base of Heaven, the foot of the Great Throne, The Garden Of Gan-Eden,... and the possibility/likelyhood (and also concrete accounts of) a supernatural gateway, doorway or bridge that connects all dimensions, (called 'marine sponge' by some) alluding to the exact x-y axis of earth being a null-point, a singularity where all matter is condensed and has the same properties, or where some great force emanates from such as the \"flower of life\", or the fibonnacci sequence, the golden ratio.  The gentlemen involved in the expeditions gave very accurate information as they used somewhat sophisticated equipment such as an astrolabe and Jacob Staff. Using these tools, the expert cartographers, explorers and mapmakers created invaluable: drawings, reports and maps of the natural earthly traits found at our the earth's 'center', directly under the Zenith known as the Pole Star.

Does water like the 'level' used by a carpenter always settle flat? Is that repeatable? Has water ever settle to the side of a curved surface or a ball? When boats have supposedly been viewed disappearing over the curvature of the sea or lake in front of witnesses, then they observed that our Earth is much much smaller than we have been educated. If the Earth is a ball, and the boat is disappearing so close, then the horizon line of the water and the earth would surely curve downwards to either side of said boat? Why are people who witness boats disappearing over the curvature of the earth/water are able to take a zoom camera/telescope and find the boat again in its' entirety? How do periscopes work in submarines if water is so curved; wouldn't the periscope point into the sky?\n\n+ Science definition:\n...the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.\n\n+ Scientific method definition:\n...a method of procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.\n\n+ Google search: \"pictures of earth from space\"\nhttps://www.google.ca/search?biw=771&bih=596&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=pictures+of+earth+from+space&oq=pictures+of+earth+from+space&gs_l=img.3..0l10.28149.30908.0.31840.16.13.0.0.0.0.276.1491.3j6j1.10.0....0...1.1.64.img..6.10.1474...0i67k1.VyApMiYotec\n\n+ Google search: \"pictures of stars in space\"\nhttps://www.google.ca/search?biw=771&bih=596&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=pictures+of+stars+in+space&oq=pictures+of+stars+in+space&gs_l=img.3..0j0i5i30k1j0i8i30k1.25567.27734.0.28005.14.13.0.0.0.0.260.1474.1j8j1.10.0....0...1.1.64.img..4.10.1464...35i39k1.QS_2yQBntrg\n\n+ Google search: \"pictures of satellites in space\"\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE \nThis channel may make use of copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

Does water like the 'level' used by a carpenter always settle flat? Is that repeatable? Has water ever settle to the side of a curved surface or a ball? When boats have supposedly been viewed disappearing over the curvature of the sea or lake in front of witnesses, then they observed that our Earth is much much smaller than we have been educated. If the Earth is a ball, and the boat is disappearing so close, then the horizon line of the water and the earth would surely curve downwards to either side of said boat? Why are people who witness boats disappearing over the curvature of the earth/water are able to take a zoom camera/telescope and find the boat again in its' entirety? How do periscopes work in submarines if water is so curved; wouldn't the periscope point into the sky?\n\n+ Science definition:\n...the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.\n\n+ Scientific method definition:\n...a method of procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.\n\n+ Google search: \"pictures of earth from space\"\nhttps://www.google.ca/search?biw=771&bih=596&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=pictures+of+earth+from+space&oq=pictures+of+earth+from+space&gs_l=img.3..0l10.28149.30908.0.31840.16.13.0.0.0.0.276.1491.3j6j1.10.0....0...1.1.64.img..6.10.1474...0i67k1.VyApMiYotec\n\n+ Google search: \"pictures of stars in space\"\nhttps://www.google.ca/search?biw=771&bih=596&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=pictures+of+stars+in+space&oq=pictures+of+stars+in+space&gs_l=img.3..0j0i5i30k1j0i8i30k1.25567.27734.0.28005.14.13.0.0.0.0.260.1474.1j8j1.10.0....0...1.1.64.img..4.10.1464...35i39k1.QS_2yQBntrg\n\n+ Google search: \"pictures of satellites in space\"\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE \nThis channel may make use of copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

If we cannot breath without inhaling the highly toxic heavy metal and chemical fallout from the covert climate engineering assault, how long can we possibly expect to retain our health? How long can the environment survive under such conditions? How many are now willing to reconsider their priorities? What acts of desperation can we expect from the tyrannical halls of power? Where do we go from here? \nIn a long and arduous journey,\u00a0like the fight to expose and halt climate engineering, battle fatigue becomes a factor.

If we cannot breath without inhaling the highly toxic heavy metal and chemical fallout from the covert climate engineering assault, how long can we possibly expect to retain our health? How long can the environment survive under such conditions? How many are now willing to reconsider their priorities? What acts of desperation can we expect from the tyrannical halls of power? Where do we go from here? \nIn a long and arduous journey,\u00a0like the fight to expose and halt climate engineering, battle fatigue becomes a factor. The challenges we face can seem overwhelming, but if we can summon the strength to continue our march forward one day at a time, we may yet accomplish profound good even at this late hour.

Hugh Newman follows on from his and Jim Vieira's research in 'Giants On Record' and visits the mysterious Lovelock Cave in northern Nevada. It is said to be where red-haired cannibalistic giants once lived and were killed off by the Paiute tribe hundreds of years ago as written about by Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins. They battled with these giants called the 'Si-Te-Cah' which translates as either thigh-eaters or tule-eaters. Numerous mummified remains were discovered from 1911 onwards when digging for bat guano in the cave and over 20,000 artifacts were also excavated. The earliest dating is at around 2700 BC, but the site could be much older as local caves such as Hidden Cave and Spirit Cave have yielded dates as early as 7,400 BC.

In 2017 Brett Stuart and his remoteviewing group did a project on them. The research from 2018 found that Maria suffered from a lung cavitary lesion and also a crushed spinal column. The\nremote viewed info got many things right including that Maria was found next to a baby. The remote viewing info also found that Maria was executed for committing a taboo of interbreeding with another species. She was executed in a way that destroyed her unique make-up by some kind of noxious fumes. This would correlate with her having a lung cavitary lesion. The remote viewed info also found out before Gaia and the group studying the Peruvian mummies that many of their bodies contained some kind of cybernetic implants. Another astounding discovery from the research group on the Peruvian mummies was that some of them have reptilian and mammalian characteristics such as scaled skin and no ears or nose. One of the mummies had eggs inside of its body, showing it had mammalian characteristics along with a reptile like reproductive process. The 2018 research findings show that these mummies share a human genome of up to 36%. The same mummies have a non-human genome from 63% to 80%. This is similar to the findings of the Atacama humanoid where the data was dismissed when it was found to contain human DNA. It was said to be a deformed fetus even though the bone density proved it was at least an adolescent of around 4 or 5 years of age being only 6 inches in height. The peruvian mummies, if they are legitimate and not a hoax, are showing an interspecies event. These species are possibly related to the elongated skulls found around the planet and also the large headed classical grey aliens in abduction and ufo lore. The countless artifacts around the world are showing multiple levels of interbreeding between these mostly human looking people and these large headed beings. Maria is the most human looking mummy with also the least grey alien characteristics. However, her cranial capacity is 19% more than the average human. The cranial capacity is not something that would be increased by artificial head binding. This is a fact ignored by most mainstream archeologists along with the absence of 2 cranial sutures. \n\nThe reptile like characteristics is another important factor in this area of alien research. To many, the subject of reptilians is as fringe as this area can get. However it must not be ignored that a smaller percentage of contactees or abductees report these reptilian beings. Even more important is that they appear rarely in remote viewing sessions and by different remote viewing projects or groups that have no contact. The Farsight Institute did a project where they remote viewed 'The War In Heaven' written about in many cultures. The findings were astounding and correlated with present day evidence. The remote viewers confirmed their data under blind conditions that the ancient war occured between humans on Mars and reptilians on planet Tiamat.\n\nSources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos:\n\n\nWorldwide Megalithic Civilization of Elongated Skull Rulers Part 2\nhttps://youtu.be/7usttI2Ld7g\n\nJoe McMoneagle - Remote viewing of Mars (2004) \nhttps://youtu.be/HlLq7KDU2HY\n\nThe Creation of the Asteroid Belt: A Remote-Viewing Study\nhttps://youtu.be/nNmTxoFWpMk\n\nBRETT STUART : REMOTE VIEWER : TECHNICAL INTUITION \nhttps://youtu.be/XnegR6fK49E\n\nEp. 697 FADE to BLACK Jimmy Church w/ The Troika Group : Nazca Mummy Remote Viewing : LIVE \nhttps://youtu.be/IE8uI7MF1J0\n\n19/11/18 Momies de Nazca : R\u00e9sultats Alien Project 2018 - NUR\u00c9A TV / GREPP\nhttps://youtu.be/fJFFFrqNjPE\n\nRemote Viewing Psychic Spy John Vivanco - Part 2\nhttps://youtu.be/y0W8MHbZ9N0\n\nRemote Viewing Psychic Spy John Vivanco - Part 3\nhttps://youtu.be/NXvT0OC98Nc\n\nThe Hidden History of The Human Race by Klaus Dona\nhttps://youtu.be/m7in8shVl6I\n\nESTELAS INCRE\u00cdBLES I La Dualidad de Seres de las Estrellas; M\u00e9xico ALIEN\u00cdGENA: CHAM\u00c1N PAULINO. \nhttps://youtu.be/fpPvzK2mYQU\n\nEdgar Cayce on ET's, Anunaki, Aliens & Life on Other Planets- John Van Auken\nhttps://youtu.be/0-aaKR1E8sY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticles:\n\nMayan Treasure: Time and Space Unified at Teotihuacan\nhttp://www.hharlestonjr.com/docs/Mayan-2520Treasure-2520--2520Section-2520V.pdf\n\n\nMummies of Nazca: Presentation of The Results\nhttps://www.the-alien-project.com/momies-de-nasca-resultats/\n\nThe Son of the Creator Comes | Chakra | Kundalini - Scribd\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/137907284/The-Son-of-the-Creator-Comes\n\nMayan Language and Hieroglyphics Enriched By Babylon 500 B.C.\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/397068044/97586819-SCHILDMANN-Kurt-Maya-Language-pdf\n\nLilith: Seductress, heroine or murderer?\nhttps://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/people-in-the-bible/lilith/\n\n\nSUPPORT:\nSupport and Subscribe to my youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/MetalWolfReaper\n\nMy Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/metalwolfreaper", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ezO230wLcs0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ezO230wLcs0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ezO230wLcs0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ezO230wLcs0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "MetalWolfReaper", "tags": ["elongated skulls", "brien foerster", "ancient aliens", "illuminati", "aliens", "remote view", "remote viewing", "tiamat", "ancient war", "maldek", "edgar cayce", "jalisco mexico", "alien artifacts", "ica stones", "graham hancock", "brett stuart", "righthemispheric", "courtney brown", "farsight institute", "reptilians", "nasca mummies", "nazca mummies"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Worldwide Megalithic Civilization of Elongated Skull Rulers Part 3", "description": "In November 2018 Inkari Institute did an extensive study on the mummies found in Peru.

Other environment risks include the excess pesticides seeping to our water supply or polluting our soil.

Farmers who were trying to increase the production of honey, crossbred the African honey bee with the European honey bee native to Italy and created a killing machine. This mix of genetics turned them into much more aggressive, insect of nightmares. They don\u2019t mind a good chase either. If you even consider disturbing their nest, they\u2019ll chase you  miles and have known to kill at least 1000 humans. Let\u2019s hope other hybrids won\u2019t turn out like this. \n\n\n\n\n10.

What are its benefits? Intermittent fasting is gaining huge popularity as a dietary option, but what actually happens to your body when you fast? When I first heard about water fasting, I thought, \u201cNo way am I doing this!\u201d But after doing some research and finding out about the benefits of this process, I changed my mind. And now I'm going to tell you what I experienced during my 20-day water fast. \n\nThe first 2 days were going to be the most difficult. And they were indeed! I felt incredibly hungry \u2014 almost as if I had missed several breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. My energy level dropped, and my mood left much to be desired. I was increasingly irritated, and my patience was wearing thin. \n\nTIMESTAMPS: \nThe benefits of water fasting 0:43\nDays 1\u20132 2:23\nDays 3\u20137 3:19\nDays 8\u201314 4:37\nDays 15\u201320 5:31\n\n#waterfasting #waterchallenge\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ \n\nSUMMARY: \n- When your body can't get access to carbohydrates (its favorite source of energy), it starts to use stored fats. As a result, you can lose about 1 lb of fat every day. This makes water fasting one of the most effective short-term weight loss methods.\n- Water fasting can also help if you have digestive problems like irritable bowel, diarrhea, gas, gastritis, constipation, or loss of appetite.\n- The first 2 days were going to be the most difficult. I felt incredibly hungry \u2014 almost as if I had missed several breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.\n- On the third day, the second stage of my water fasting began. By that time, the much-awaited process of ketosis had started. That's when your body gets down to burning the fat it has stored as it has no other sources of energy.\n- After the first week of feeding myself nothing but water, I experienced a kind of \u201cfasting high.\u201d I felt great, happy, and impressively energetic. But what pleased me the most was a particular clarity of mind.\n- When I got to the fifteenth day of my water fasting, I was incredibly proud of myself! I knew that very few people reach this stage. I also knew that this was a period when I had to be immensely attentive to my condition and visit a doctor if I felt that something had gone wrong.\n- Believe it or not, I felt at my best after my water fast. I lost some weight (though not as much as I\u2019d expected). My vitals were impressive in a good way, and some health abnormalities were no longer a cause for concern. \n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.brightside.me/", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4DwmXK9gEY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4DwmXK9gEY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4DwmXK9gEY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4DwmXK9gEY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4DwmXK9gEY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "BRIGHT SIDE", "tags": ["healthy lifestyle", "unhealthy lifestyle", "no food", "no food for a week", "what if you stopped eating", "experiment", "health experiment", "water fast", "water fasting", "stay healthy", "avoid health problems", "protect yourself", "fasting", "intermittent fasting", "how to fast", "dieting", "avoid stress", "skip breakfast", "eating disorders", "brightside", "bright side video", "bright side"], "categoryId": "26", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "I Drank Only Water for 20 Days, See What Happened to My Body", "description": "What is water fasting?

And now I'm going to tell you what I experienced during my 20-day water fast. \n\nThe first 2 days were going to be the most difficult. And they were indeed! I felt incredibly hungry \u2014 almost as if I had missed several breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. My energy level dropped, and my mood left much to be desired. I was increasingly irritated, and my patience was wearing thin. \n\nTIMESTAMPS: \nThe benefits of water fasting 0:43\nDays 1\u20132 2:23\nDays 3\u20137 3:19\nDays 8\u201314 4:37\nDays 15\u201320 5:31\n\n#waterfasting #waterchallenge\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ \n\nSUMMARY: \n- When your body can't get access to carbohydrates (its favorite source of energy), it starts to use stored fats. As a result, you can lose about 1 lb of fat every day. This makes water fasting one of the most effective short-term weight loss methods.\n- Water fasting can also help if you have digestive problems like irritable bowel, diarrhea, gas, gastritis, constipation, or loss of appetite.\n- The first 2 days were going to be the most difficult. I felt incredibly hungry \u2014 almost as if I had missed several breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.\n- On the third day, the second stage of my water fasting began. By that time, the much-awaited process of ketosis had started. That's when your body gets down to burning the fat it has stored as it has no other sources of energy.\n- After the first week of feeding myself nothing but water, I experienced a kind of \u201cfasting high.\u201d I felt great, happy, and impressively energetic. But what pleased me the most was a particular clarity of mind.\n- When I got to the fifteenth day of my water fasting, I was incredibly proud of myself! I knew that very few people reach this stage. I also knew that this was a period when I had to be immensely attentive to my condition and visit a doctor if I felt that something had gone wrong.\n- Believe it or not, I felt at my best after my water fast. I lost some weight (though not as much as I\u2019d expected). My vitals were impressive in a good way, and some health abnormalities were no longer a cause for concern. \n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\n\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\nhttp://www.brightside.me/"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT7M45S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "8326322", "likeCount": "121987", "dislikeCount": "10069", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "11304"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "RBaI0aywf292DpdCuhOvEu23JHc", "id": "_PUO1HMsmao", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-12-11T19:13:38Z", "channelId": "UCkQO3QsgTpNTsOw6ujimT5Q", "title": "Rare Diseases That Give People Superhero-Like Abilities", "description": "At one point we've all dreamt of being a superhero.

Sit tight, because the future of gaming, and everything else, is about to change forever.\n\nIf you look up in the corner of your phone, you\u2019re probably used to seeing a little indicator that says 4G LTE or, 3G, or... god forbid, 2G \u2013 and you\u2019ve come to recognize that it probably has something to do with your phone\u2019s connection to your mobile network. The higher the G, the faster the connection. It\u2019s pretty easy to follow, the G stands for generation, and each subsequent generation refers to a specific minimum speed, connectivity, and reliability necessary to classify the network as that particular generation. 1G let us talk to each other, 2G let us send messages, 3G gave us broad data and internet, and 4G/LTE made it a whole lot faster.\n\nBut all that is in the soon to be past, because up on the horizon is 5G. And while you may be thinking that 5G is just a little faster, a little more reliable, and a little newer \u2013 it\u2019s actually a massive breakthrough that\u2019s going to change the way devices connect to the internet, and more importantly, to each other. In fact, as 5G rolls out over the next two years, it\u2019s going to change\u2026 well, everything with a wireless connection. Which, at this point is \u2026well, pretty much everything. So, what\u2019s so special about a 5G future?\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s fast. Like, really fast. Like, 20 gigabits per second over wireless fast. Like 100 - 250 times faster than 4G. By comparison, 4G provides speeds, on average, of about 10 - 20 megabits a second. So that\u2019s going from streaming one Netflix movie in HD, to streaming 400 movies in 8k at the same time.\n\nBut that\u2019s not really the most impressive part\u2026 what sets 5G aside is its crazy low latency rate, which is the amount of delay between the sending and receiving of information. Now, 4G tends to average about 100-200 milliseconds. To be fair, 100 milliseconds is FAST; human reaction time is about 200-300 milliseconds. But 5G\u2026 will get it down to 1 millisecond. Or less. That\u2019s almost real-time. And being able to send and receive information in what is essentially real-time, means that we can use 5G\u2026 to replace real-time interactions.\n\nThat might be one of the biggest breakthroughs in 5G: a network of self driving cars \u2013 all sending data between each other, and communicating with traffic lights, road sensors, aerial drones, and so on. Think about it, human reaction speed is 200 milliseconds, and we still have accidents every day. Imagine if your car could react, and communicate its reaction to hundreds of cars around it, all within a millisecond. Not only could we end car accidents, hell, we could end traffic altogether. Hundreds of self-driving cars, going lightning fast to your destination, with no risk that they\u2019ll hit each other, because they all know exactly where they are in real-time, reacting to the actual world around them. Autonomous or remotely controlled trains, delivery trucks, even airplanes could be on the horizon in the near future.\n\nIn fact, forget cars for a second, and think of all robotic devices. Surgeries could be performed, from the other side of the world, with robot surgeons controlled in real-time by expert surgeons, being assisted by other expert surgeons simultaneously; saving lives in situations where time and distance are the difference between life and death. Factories can be staffed by robots that can communicate their task and position to each other, allowing them to not only do more, but do it more efficiently, and wirelessly over a 5G network. Imagine a fleet of drones flying over a field of crops, using sensors on the ground, to sort, pick, feed, and water individual plants \u2013 all on their own.\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR THE LATEST VIDEOS\nhttp://bit.ly/DTYouTubeSub\n\nVISIT DIGITAL TRENDS \nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/\n\nDT Series---\nBehind the Wheel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XpfdRhHgyU&list=PLZEIwIHCxaFXVeqr527QvNAGf-hhUohdM\n\nAwesome Tech you can't buy Yet: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Lkq0EjQfk&list=PLZEIwIHCxaFX_dLKzcbRveMM-iIG4J0PN\n\nInnovators: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NMa2nV1rr8&list=PLZEIwIHCxaFWho_JFi2OwREEnYIkiSGNN\n\nConnect my Crib: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8nNy0li7Qg&list=PLZEIwIHCxaFU_lCSkTEclp7ihsLGzYUaK\n\nFOLLOW US!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/digitaltrends\nhttps://twitter.com/digitaltrends\nhttps://www.instagram.com/digitaltrends\nhttps://plus.google.com/+digitaltrends/posts", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MC_Sfkh5-zQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MC_Sfkh5-zQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MC_Sfkh5-zQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MC_Sfkh5-zQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Digital Trends", "tags": ["5g technology", "internet of things", "5g cell towers", "5g network", "5g connections", "smart cities", "5g technology what you need to know", "5g technology 2018", "digital trends", "5g the future of mobile wireless", "the future of 5g", "news", "tech", "5g", "mobile", "cell service", "mobile phones", "5g mobile", "5g phones", "5g development", "5g telecommunications", "5g smartphone", "5g bands", "4g vs 5g", "5g qualcomm", "5g spectrum", "5g applications", "5g phone", "tech news", "digital trends 2019", "digital trends 2018"], "categoryId": "28", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "How 5G will change your smartphone, and your life in 2019", "description": "Imagine playing a co-op shooter like Fortnite Battle Royale or PUB-G on a VR headset\u2026 in real-time, with zero lag\u2026 all through your phone, while travelling in a fleet of self-driving cars going 200 miles an hour.

Curt Linderman speaks with Dr. Blaylock about the devastating health effects of the chemtrails and geoengineering programs which have been implemented in secret without public consent.\n\nChemtrails, Nanoaluminum and Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Effects\nBy Russell L. Blaylock, M.D. \n\nThe Internet is littered with stories of \"chemtrails\" and geoengineering to combat \"global warming\" and until recently I took these stories with a grain of salt. One of the main reasons for my skepticism was that I rarely saw what they were describing in the skies. But over the past several years I have notice a great number of these trails and I have to admit they are not like the contrails I grew up seeing in the skies. They are extensive, quite broad, are laid in a definite pattern and slowly evolve into artificial clouds. Of particular concern is that there are now so many \u00addozens every day are littering the skies.\n\nMy major concern is that there is evidence that they are spraying tons of nanosized aluminum compounds. It has been demonstrated in the scientific and medical literature that nanosized particles are infinitely more reactive and induce intense inflammation in a number of tissues. Of special concern is the effect of these nanoparticles on the brain and spinal cord, as a growing list of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's dementia, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS) are strongly related to exposure to environmental aluminum. \nNanoparticles of aluminum are not only infinitely more inflammatory, they also easily penetrate the brain by a number of routes, including the blood and olfactory nerves (the smell nerves in the nose). Studies have shown that these particles pass along the olfactory neural tracts, which connect directly to the area of the brain that is not only most effected by Alzheimer's disease, but also the earliest affected in the course of the disease. It also has the highest level of brain aluminum in Alzheimer's cases.\n\nThe intranasal route of exposure makes spraying of massive amounts of nanoaluminum into the skies especially hazardous, as it will be inhaled by people of all ages, including babies and small children for many hours. We know that older people have the greatest reaction to this airborne aluminum. Because of the nanosizing of the aluminum particles being used, home filtering system will not remove the aluminum, thus prolonging exposure, even indoors.\nIn addition to inhaling nanoaluminum, such spraying will saturate the ground, water and vegetation with high levels of aluminum. Normally, aluminum is poorly absorbed from the GI tract, but nanoaluminum is absorbed in much higher amounts. This absorbed aluminum has been shown to be distributed to a number of organs and tissues including the brain and spinal cord. Inhaling this environmentally suspended nanoaluminum will also produce tremendous inflammatory reaction within the lungs, which will pose a significant hazard to children and adults with asthma and pulmonary diseases. \n\nI pray that the pilots who are spraying this dangerous substance fully understand that they are destroying the life and health of their families as well. This is also true of our political officials. Once the soil, plants and water sources are heavily contaminated there will be no way to reverse the damage that has been done.\nSteps need to be taken now to prevent an impending health disaster of enormous proportions if this project is not stopped immediately. Otherwise we will see an explosive increase in neurodegenerative diseases occurring in adults and the elderly in unprecedented rates as well as neurodevelopmental disorders in our children. We are already seeing a dramatic increase in these neurological disorders and it is occurring in younger people than ever before.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3lW-TGGlk0/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3lW-TGGlk0/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3lW-TGGlk0/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X3lW-TGGlk0/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Russell Blaylock M.D", "tags": ["Infertility", "depopulation", "eugenics", "CFR", "Rockefeller", "vaccines", "immunization"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "What Chemtrails Are Doing To Your Brain - Neurosurgeon Dr. Russell Blaylock Reveals Shocking Facts.", "description": "Linderman Unleashed Radio Show March 28th 2013 Broadcast.

One of those areas is Mariana Trench \u2013 a narrow fissure in the sea floor, located in the western part of the Pacific. The trench is the deepest known region on the planet and was formed millions of years ago.\nNumber 10 Northern Patagonia, Chile\nHosting Chile's wildest landscapes, the area hides untouched rainforests, peaks, rivers, and lakes. The field of northern Patagonia is also home to one of the largest masses of ice found outside of the polar region.\nNumber 9 Machapuchare Mountain\nMachapuchare is a sacred peak for the Hindu religion. It\u2019s said that Lord Shiva, an important Hindu deity, lives here. The \u2018Fish Tail Mountain\u2019 gets its name from the shape of the peak as seen from a certain angle.\nNumber 8 Sarlacc Pit, Canada\nA giant gaping cave was found in Canada in 2018 and it was named Sarlacc Pit, after the pit-dwelling beast in Star Wars. The discovery of the cave, concealed in the ground of the British Columbia's Provincial Park, was a remarkable achievement for the explorers.\nNumber 7 New Hebrides Trench\nAlthough we\u2019ve reached to the sky in exploration, very few attempted to go in the other direction. We may know more today about stars and galaxies than we know about Earth\u2019s oceans. There are more than 30 deep-sea trenches around the world and most can be found in the Pacific Ocean. In 2013 an expedition to the unexplored New Hebrides trench in the Pacific has revealed, with the help of high-tech cameras, the abundance of crustaceans and cusk eels that live more than 23,000 feet deep.\nNumber 6 Star Mountains, Papua New Guinea\nThe Star Mountains is a massive mountain range extending from the Indonesian border to the Hinderberg wall. It\u2019s a network of huge limestone plateaus, up to 6,000 feet tall and 30 miles long, that protect the area.\nNumber 5 Gamburtsev Mountains, Antarctica\nMountains the size of the Alps have been found in Antarctica, entombed in ice \u2013 suggesting that the ice sheet formed more rapidly than scientists initially thought. Using gravity and radar sensors, maps were created showing details of the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains.\nNumber 4 Yucatan Cenotes, Mexico \nThere are thousands of cenotes all across Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, places that once were revered by the Mayans as sacred wells, and still an attraction for people worldwide. The Yucatan is characterized mainly by its limestone bedrock, a soluble type of rock that can dissolve after being exposed to water for millennia. The collapse of limestones sometimes reveals the cave underneath, thus marking the birth of a cenote. The caves fill over time with water filtered directly by the earth, creating lakes and stunning views. Since there aren\u2019t many rivers in the Yucatan, they were once the primary source of water for the Mayans.\nNumber 3 Gangkhar Puensum, Bhutan\nGangkhar Puensum, in translation \u2018White Peak of the Three Spiritual Brothers\u2019, is the highest mountain in Bhutan, with its peak reaching almost 25,000 feet. Most of the sources say that it\u2019s located at the border with China. However, for many years, different maps would show it as various heights and even place it in completely different locations. It\u2019s said to be the highest mountain in the world that has still not been fully summited by man. There have been four expeditions, none of them successful due to impassable terrain and sudden weather changes.\nNumber 2 Sahka Federal Republic, Russia\nOne-fifth of Russia is covered by the Siberian Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia. The major part is located above the Arctic Circle. The hard soil which is covered by permafrost, make Yakutia a deadly place to live. In July, some parts of Yakutia can reach up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, whilst the average recorded temperature is as low as -50 degrees. Sahka is one of the few places on Earth where the mountains, rivers, and lakes are still untouched by civilization.\nNumber 1 Tsingy de Bemahara National Park, Madagascar\nTsingy de Bemahara, translating as \u2018Where one cannot walk barefoot\u2019, is a national park located in Madagascar covered in huge rock formations. With the help of the locals, a set of suspended bridges and steel cables was built, allowing the landscape to be seen from the air. However, getting to the park is still no easy feat. Located on the remote west coast of Madagascar, Tsingy de Bemahara is only accessible by a dirt road, which becomes unnavigable for six months a year during the rainy season.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEMxXlZS6WE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEMxXlZS6WE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IEMxXlZS6WE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "They will Kill You", "tags": ["Places", "earth", "human", "foot", "untouched", "incredible", "locations", "stunning", "spots", "traveling", "country", "water", "mountain", "nature", "amazing", "climbing", "altitude", "depth", "visiting", "unique", "surprising", "existence", "mysterious", "untouched places", "untouched location", "incredible places", "incredible locations", "stunning spots", "forbidden places", "mariana trench", "highest mountain", "Machapuchare", "Star Mountains", "Gamburtsev Mountains", "Yucatan Cenotes", "Mexico Cenotes", "national park", "national park madagascar"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "11 Places on Earth No Human Has Ever Set Foot on", "description": "\u2714 NEW MERCH AVAILABLE: https://theywillkillyou.com/\n\nPlaces on earth no human has ever set foot on.

Now that we've got some distance from the climactic installment, let's take a look back at the movies' meaning and break down the conclusion. Here's the ending of the Matrix trilogy explained. \n \nOne major theme that came to the fore as the series reached its conclusion had to do with the similarities between humans and machines. In the original, they couldn't seem more different, but by Revolutions, programs in the Matrix are portrayed as being almost more human than our heroes, loving and happy individuals, as worthy of existence as any person. Further, characters from the first film who were firmly human or machine are portrayed in the sequels as having a little bit of both.\n\nThe similarities go in both directions. Agent Smith, a program, copied his consciousness onto a human form, entering the real world through the vessel of a resistance fighter named Bane. Neo, a human, reached the Source to discover that being the One was his destiny because it was programmed into him. \n\nThe humanizing of the Machines and the complimentary mechanization of Neo made for a storytelling turn that audiences weren't really ready for. People who saw The Matrix couldn't be faulted for expecting an ending that saw Neo winning by doing his Superman thing and eradicating humanity\u2019s robot overlords. Instead, Neo triumphed by becoming a bridge between man and machine, sacrificing his own life for the sake of securing the future.\n\n He also made Hugo Weaving\u2019s head explode, but that wasn\u2019t quite as important. \n \nOne widespread but inaccurate theory about the sequels is that the \u201creal world\u201d is actually a second Matrix. While the reasons why this isn't true are explained in the movies, they're also relatively easy to misunderstand.\n\nThe real world isn't another level of the Matrix, but it is involved in another system of control. As the Architect explains at the ending of The Matrix Reloaded, each version of the Matrix is propped up in the real world by a controlled rebellion. With each new iteration of the Matrix, a select portion of the population is freed, allowed to live in Zion. There, they help to liberate people still inside the Matrix, searching for the One. \n\nFinding the One, the human rebels rally behind them, supporting them until they reach the Source. There, the One discovers that they are not meant to destroy the Matrix, but rather restart it. At this point in the cycle, the Machines attack Zion and destroy it, killing the rebellion. \n\nThe One, having reached the Source, is made to choose between either reloading the Matrix and selecting a handful of survivors to build a new Zion, or walking away, supposedly causing a system crash, leaving the humans inside and outside of the Matrix all dead. \n\nUp until Neo, every One made the choice to restart, perpetuating the system of control. Because Neo loves Trinity, he chooses to sacrifice everything to be with her. This is the choice that makes him special.

Because Neo loves Trinity, he chooses to sacrifice everything to be with her. This is the choice that makes him special.

If you think back to World War II and see the weapons compared to today\u2019s weapons, it\u2019s simply mind-boggling just how far advanced things are becoming, and from the looks of it, warfare is poised to become more dangerous than it ever was. From drones in the sky, drone tanks fitted with incredible weaponry, to small unmanned aircraft that are launched from carriers in the sky! Security clearance has been granted! Check out these insane secret military weapons. \n\nRussia\u2019s Nuclear Tsunami Apocalypse Torpedo 'Poseidon'\nYou might have heard of Russia\u2019s new weapon which was called \u2018Status-6\u2019 or KANYON. It was once thought that the weapon was a hoax until researchers tracked the development of the system which began in 2008. \n\nDrones Recharged by a Laser Could Fly Forever\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has developed a drone that has solar panels that are built into the wings, and batteries in the fuselage. The batteries provide the power, but as they begin to drain, drone operators aim a laser beam at the solar panels which recharge the batteries.\n\nChina's Giant Ionosphere-Zapping Radar \nThis weapon developed by the Chinese is described as a \u2018high-powered incoherent scatter radar\u2019 and is supposed to bounce radio waves off the Earth's high-altitude layer of charged gas called the ionosphere.\n\nProject Thor\nAlthough this project has some limitation with our current technology, it\u2019s something that is still on the table... we\u2019re talking about a weaponized meteor strike. In the 1950\u2019s a Boeing operations researcher by the name of Jerry Pournelle envisioned a weapons system armed not with conventional munitions or chemical explosives, but massive rods forged from the heavy metal \u2018Tungsten\u2019 which would be dropped from sub-orbital heights.\n\nJuliet Marine Systems Ghost \nThe GHOST is an advanced super-cavitating stealth ship that reduces hull friction to 1/900th that of conventional watercraft. The Ghost uses a gyro-stabilized dual-pontoon super-cavitating hull that can run at top speed through 10-foot waves. \n\nSea Dragon Weapon\nThe U.S. Navy and an unknown defense contractor are working on a new missile the service says will give its submarines a new, \u2018disruptive offensive capability\u2019 to take on enemy ships. It\u2019s called the Sea Dragon but no one is really sure what it is because it\u2019s top secret. \n\n Drone Tank \nMilitary drones are on the rise and many of you are probably familiar with the unmanned US Predator drones that are equipped with advanced targeting systems and can carry 500-pound bombs and deliver those weapons to the target accurately. \n\nTank-Killing Quadcopter Drone\nThe armed forces of Belarus have demonstrated a new quadcopter drone that can carry a tank-killing rocket launcher which carries an RPG-26 single-shot rocket that is remotely fired by the drone operator. \n\nIron Curtain\nWith the name of \u2018Iron Curtain,\u2019 you might think this is a secret Russian military weapon, but it\u2019s not. The U.S. Army is testing a system designed to protect military vehicles smaller than tanks from attacks.\n\nGremlins Aircraft Carriers\nThe idea of an aircraft carrier that operates in the air is not a new idea. And aside from the fictional flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier which appeared in the American comic books published by Marvel Comics, it would seem this is an impossible feat. But not so fast. \n\nWe hope you enjoyed the video and want to know what you thought about these and which was your favorite.

Isn't the whole of Las Vegas a tourist trap? Yes, Las Vegas is designed to attracts tourists, but tourist traps are those who deliberately mislead and overcharge or who use tempting offers to lure the unsuspecting tourist. They don\u2019t care if you ever come back they got your money once and hook new suckers daily. I do not consider tourist traps things that are popular with tourists, I like popular tourist attractions!  That\u2019s why they are popular, people like them!\n\n1 - Club Promoters on the strip\nIf there\u2019s one rule of thumb in the Las Vegas nightlife scene is you get what you pay for.  The Las Vegas strip is full of promoters offering free VIP pases to just about any club.  They promise free drinks or to bypass the line.  The deals are usually to good to be true.  Bypass the line is usually only good early in the night when there is no line.  And free drinks might only be up until a certain time.  And never pay for a VIP pass on the strip, the promoter is already getting a cut from the club when \n2- the gelato stand in the Forum Shops which I'm calling out because of the $10 for two small scoops\n3 - Time share people asking \"how long are you in town for\", \"can I interest you in show tickets\"\nDon't listen to the timeshare people. Just keep walking- don't talk to them/don't make eye contact with them.  Their free show tickets are a trap and a waste of time.  They won\u2019t cost you money, but will cost you your precious time.\n4 - the rides on top of the Stratosphere. Three rides on top of the Strat...$36.\n5 - Posing for pictures on the strip with characters...whether they be Elvis, or show girls, or a character from whatever the latest movie is.\n6 - RESORT FEES... just put them in the price already!!! We ALL know they're mandatory!!!  That $17 isn\u2019t $17 when it has a $40 resort fee!\n7- Cabo Wabo, PBR, & Margaretville below average food not worth the price. The setting sucks you in.\n8 - Restaurants endorsed by celebrity chefs.  You can expect to fork over $300-400 for a meal for 2 people at some of these places\n9 - Three Card Monte\n Also known as a shell game, you\u2019d think everybody would know about this, but it\u2019s still alive and kicking in Vegas on the strip.

Isn't the whole of Las Vegas a tourist trap? Yes, Las Vegas is designed to attracts tourists, but tourist traps are those who deliberately mislead and overcharge or who use tempting offers to lure the unsuspecting tourist. They don\u2019t care if you ever come back they got your money once and hook new suckers daily. I do not consider tourist traps things that are popular with tourists, I like popular tourist attractions!  That\u2019s why they are popular, people like them!\n\n1 - Club Promoters on the strip\nIf there\u2019s one rule of thumb in the Las Vegas nightlife scene is you get what you pay for.  The Las Vegas strip is full of promoters offering free VIP pases to just about any club.  They promise free drinks or to bypass the line.  The deals are usually to good to be true.  Bypass the line is usually only good early in the night when there is no line.  And free drinks might only be up until a certain time.  And never pay for a VIP pass on the strip, the promoter is already getting a cut from the club when \n2- the gelato stand in the Forum Shops which I'm calling out because of the $10 for two small scoops\n3 - Time share people asking \"how long are you in town for\", \"can I interest you in show tickets\"\nDon't listen to the timeshare people. Just keep walking- don't talk to them/don't make eye contact with them.  Their free show tickets are a trap and a waste of time.  They won\u2019t cost you money, but will cost you your precious time.\n4 - the rides on top of the Stratosphere. Three rides on top of the Strat...$36.\n5 - Posing for pictures on the strip with characters...whether they be Elvis, or show girls, or a character from whatever the latest movie is.\n6 - RESORT FEES... just put them in the price already!!! We ALL know they're mandatory!!!  That $17 isn\u2019t $17 when it has a $40 resort fee!\n7- Cabo Wabo, PBR, & Margaretville below average food not worth the price. The setting sucks you in.\n8 - Restaurants endorsed by celebrity chefs.  You can expect to fork over $300-400 for a meal for 2 people at some of these places\n9 - Three Card Monte\n Also known as a shell game, you\u2019d think everybody would know about this, but it\u2019s still alive and kicking in Vegas on the strip.  Dealers setup a makeshift table with a cardbox box or something and ask players to be on a card that will be shuffled with the others.  If you pick correctly you double your money.  Except when they shuffle they switch your card with another one all together.  You can never win.\n\n10 - Bacchanal Buffet -- $64.99 for dinner.  Want to skip the line and make reservation?  Book the vip package for $94.99 a person!\n\n\n13 - \nThe High Roller Rollercoaster & Madame Tussaud's\n\nSome more things to avoid in Las Vegas:\nAny margarita under $3.\nPoker, BJ, and craps after drinking heavily.\nFriendly \"single\" women at bars.\nWatch or hold something for a stranger\nAccept a casino casino chip from a stranger in exchange for cash\nSet your purse or bag on the floor when playing\nWade in the Bellagio (or any other) fountain\nAllow your cab drive to use the tunnel \"to avoid construction\"\nBe aware of the fact that many of the monorail stations are set way back from the strip and it is a hike to get to/from them.

Part 1 focuses on cutting the cedar logs for the foundations of the viking house. The foundations are only going to be two cedar logs high. The hand tools we use are an axe, saw, hammer, and wrecking bar. We begin by using an axe and saw to create saddle notches to make the log cabin foundation. We are only building the foundation two cedar logs high, because the timber frame of the roof will come right down to the forest floor. We use 10 logs overall for the foundation of the viking shelter. We burned the ends of the support stakes using Shou-Sugi Ban. An ancient wood preserving technique invented by the Japanese. It helps to evaporate any moisture in the wood and creates a sealed, protective layer to help prevent it from rotting as quickly. Cedar is pretty rot proof and is often used in Log Cabin building. We cook up some food over the fire and then finish the foundation of the Bushcraft Viking House in the woods. \nIn Part 2, we will be focusing on building the timber frame of the structure. Using cedar logs and hand tools. We hope to build a viking long pit, raised beds, a door and a porch. Eventually we hope to cook venison and other food over the open fire inside the viking camp.

Part 1 focuses on cutting the cedar logs for the foundations of the viking house. The foundations are only going to be two cedar logs high. The hand tools we use are an axe, saw, hammer, and wrecking bar. We begin by using an axe and saw to create saddle notches to make the log cabin foundation. We are only building the foundation two cedar logs high, because the timber frame of the roof will come right down to the forest floor. We use 10 logs overall for the foundation of the viking shelter. We burned the ends of the support stakes using Shou-Sugi Ban. An ancient wood preserving technique invented by the Japanese. It helps to evaporate any moisture in the wood and creates a sealed, protective layer to help prevent it from rotting as quickly. Cedar is pretty rot proof and is often used in Log Cabin building. We cook up some food over the fire and then finish the foundation of the Bushcraft Viking House in the woods. \nIn Part 2, we will be focusing on building the timber frame of the structure. Using cedar logs and hand tools. We hope to build a viking long pit, raised beds, a door and a porch. Eventually we hope to cook venison and other food over the open fire inside the viking camp.

The author of the letter claimed that Elon was a \u201cchild of the Illuminati\u201d being bred to be a world leader who can present the Mark of the Beast. While such ideas are not completely ridiculous or out of line, especially on this channel, it was worth digging into some of what was claimed in the letter. \n\nTo my surprise, I was able to verify that Elon Musk\u2019s grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was in fact part of the Canadian Technocracy movement in the 1930\u2019s to the point of being brought to trial after Technocracy was banned. While many others did not get arrested, Elon\u2019s grandfather \u201cwasn\u2019t so lucky.\u201d But he was let go with all charges dropped, which in hindsight, breeds all kinds of suspicion. Later that decade, he fathered Maye and Kaye (twins) in 1948 after marrying his second wife (he had 5 total children). He would then take his family (including Maye) on expeditions to the Kalahari desert of South Africa, searching for a lost civilization that many revisionist and alt. historians consider part of the ancient city of Atlantis. \n\nThe other part of the handwritten letter claimed that Maye was into African witchcraft, which is plausible given she moved to South Africa (age 2-3) and lived there for many years of her youth. The mention of Maye\u2019s connection to Charles Manson and the Manson crime family in the letter is something I was unable to verify with my short and limited research for this video. It is interesting to note however, that there are literally no results on Google, Bing, Startpage and the rest, that actually contains the keyphrases \u201cMaye Musk\u201d or \u201cMaye Haldeman\u201d and \u201cCharles Manson.\u201d This could mean that there really is nothing there, or, it might be a purposeful \u201cwhite washing\u201d of any information that can be found on the topic online. \n\nThe letter goes on to state that Kaye Haldeman not only visited Charles Manson at one point in prison, becoming popular with the crime family by providing TV\u2019s and other luxuries, but that she also conceived Elon\u2019s sister Tosca at some point during her visits as well. These claims are impossible for me to verify. \n\nOne thing that CAN be verified if someone can dig it up, is the claim that Maye is actually in a photo on the original Helter Skelter book. But again, this was a little bit outside of my resources for this video. \n\nFinally, the letter claimed that Elon was \u201cinto darkness\u201d and that he even levitated! Again, these are claims that I cannot verify. It\u2019s hard for me to believe anyone can actually levitate, but perhaps if he truly is assisted by dark spiritual beings, anything is possible, at least illusory.\n\nNo matter what the agenda behind Elon Musk and his technocratic family, we can rest easy knowing that Jesus Christ already defeated death, and promised us the eternal life that the elite men who run the world seek, simply for repenting and believing in Him! Mark of the beast or not, we can know the truth will set us free\n\n*LINKS*\n\nMAYE MUSK\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maye_Musk\nhttps://bit.ly/2yt9JqH\nhttps://nyti.ms/2PeAdWq\nhttps://read.bi/2EBBTFm \nhttps://bit.ly/2q3up48\nhttps://read.bi/2EBBTFm \nhttps://bit.ly/2PL4Q2X \n\nELON MUSK\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk \n\nELON\u2019s GRANDPA (Joshua D.

The most prominent of these, the versions by Antipater of Sidon and an observer identified as Philo of Byzantium, comprise seven works located around the eastern Mediterranean rim. The original list inspired innumerable versions through the ages, often listing seven entries.

The Walters Art Museum.\n\nThe Greek conquest of much of the known world in the 4th century BC gave Hellenistic travellers access to the civilizations of the Egyptians, Persians, and Babylonians. Impressed and captivated by the landmarks and marvels of the various lands, these travellers began to list what they saw to remember them.\n\nInstead of \"wonders\", the ancient Greeks spoke of \"theamata\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1), which means \"sights\", in other words \"things to be seen\".

Hence, the list was meant to be the Ancient World's counterpart of a travel guidebook.\n\nEach person had his own version of the list, but the best known and earliest surviving was from a poem by Greek-speaking epigrammist Antipater of Sidon from around 140 BC. He named six of the seven sites on his list\u2014leaving out the lighthouse\u2014, but was primarily in praise of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus\n\nAnother 2nd century BC observer, who claimed to be the mathematician Philo of Byzantium, wrote a short account entitled The Seven Sights of the World. However, the incomplete surviving manuscript only covered six of the supposedly seven places, which agreed with Antipater's list.\n\nEarlier and later lists by the historian Herodotus (484 BC--ca. 425 BC) and the architect Callimachus of Cyrene (ca. 305--240 BC), housed at the Museum of Alexandria, survived only as references.\n\nThe Colossus of Rhodes was the last of the seven to be completed, after 280 BC, and the first to be destroyed, by an earthquake in 226/225 BC. Hence, all seven existed at the same time for a period of less than 60 years. Antipater had an earlier version which replaced Lighthouse of Alexandria with the Walls of Babylon. Lists which preceded the construction of Colossus of Rhodes completed their seven entries with the inclusion of the Ishtar Gate.\n\nScope\n\nIt is thought that the limitation of the lists to seven entries was attributed to the special magical meaning of the number. Geographically, the list covered only the sculptural and architectural monuments of the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions, which then comprised the known world for the Greeks. Hence, extant sites beyond this realm were not considered as part of contemporary accounts.\n\nThe primary accounts, coming from Hellenistic writers, also heavily influenced the places included in the wonders list. Five of the seven entries are a celebration of Greek accomplishments in the arts and architecture (the exceptions being the Pyramids of Giza and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon).", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3aY9Se-J2ww/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3aY9Se-J2ww/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3aY9Se-J2ww/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3aY9Se-J2ww/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3aY9Se-J2ww/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Documentaries HD", "tags": ["Wonders Of The World (Literature Subject)", "Television Documentary (TV Genre)", "BBC", "Earth", "Ancient Pyramid", "Giza", "History", "BBC Documentary", "British Broadcasting Corporation (Production Company)", "World Documentary", "World", "The Seven Wonders Of The World - BBC Documentary"], "categoryId": "1", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "The Seven Wonders Of The World - BBC Documentary", "description": "Check out some other documentaries:\nhttp://bit.ly/1Wz4igV\n\nThe Seven Wonders of the World (or the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) refers to remarkable constructions of classical antiquity listed by various authors in guidebooks popular among the ancient Hellenic tourists, particularly in the 1st and 2nd centuries BC.

(\u03a4\u1f70 \u1f11\u03c0\u03c4\u1f70 \u03b8\u03b5\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 [\u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2] T\u00e0 hept\u00e0 the\u00e1mata t\u0113s oikoumen\u0113s [g\u0113s]) Later, the word for \"wonder\" (\"thaumata\" \u03b8\u03b1\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1) was used, and this is also the case in modern Greek (\u0395\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac \u03b8\u03b1\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5). Hence, the list was meant to be the Ancient World's counterpart of a travel guidebook.\n\nEach person had his own version of the list, but the best known and earliest surviving was from a poem by Greek-speaking epigrammist Antipater of Sidon from around 140 BC. He named six of the seven sites on his list\u2014leaving out the lighthouse\u2014, but was primarily in praise of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus\n\nAnother 2nd century BC observer, who claimed to be the mathematician Philo of Byzantium, wrote a short account entitled The Seven Sights of the World. However, the incomplete surviving manuscript only covered six of the supposedly seven places, which agreed with Antipater's list.\n\nEarlier and later lists by the historian Herodotus (484 BC--ca. 425 BC) and the architect Callimachus of Cyrene (ca. 305--240 BC), housed at the Museum of Alexandria, survived only as references.\n\nThe Colossus of Rhodes was the last of the seven to be completed, after 280 BC, and the first to be destroyed, by an earthquake in 226/225 BC. Hence, all seven existed at the same time for a period of less than 60 years. Antipater had an earlier version which replaced Lighthouse of Alexandria with the Walls of Babylon. Lists which preceded the construction of Colossus of Rhodes completed their seven entries with the inclusion of the Ishtar Gate.\n\nScope\n\nIt is thought that the limitation of the lists to seven entries was attributed to the special magical meaning of the number. Geographically, the list covered only the sculptural and architectural monuments of the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions, which then comprised the known world for the Greeks. Hence, extant sites beyond this realm were not considered as part of contemporary accounts.\n\nThe primary accounts, coming from Hellenistic writers, also heavily influenced the places included in the wonders list. Five of the seven entries are a celebration of Greek accomplishments in the arts and architecture (the exceptions being the Pyramids of Giza and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon)."}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H35M48S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "5267781", "likeCount": "14632", "dislikeCount": "1746", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1461"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "c10a03Uy4YQQW25pYopk-1qF-aw", "id": "vFymKqUwodY", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-03-12T22:07:25Z", "channelId": "UCajXeitgFL-rb5-gXI-aG8Q", "title": "Building a Prosthetic Arm With Lego", "description": "Ever since he was a kid, David Aguilar was obsessed with Lego.

The most feasible method to trigger fusion in a FGNW is to use microscopic amounts of anti-matter.\n\nQ: What advantages do FGNWs have over conventional nukes?\nA: They are \"clean\" (radioactive fallout negligible, about on par with conventional depleted uranium weapons that are already in use), they are very small (potentially can fit in your pocket), and fill in the \"yield gap\" between the most powerful conventional weapons and the lowest yield conventional nukes.\n\nQ: Will FGNWs really be more politically acceptable to use in actual combat?\nA: Who knows? Only time can tell for certain, but their \"radioactive cleanness\" is a compelling argument in favor for it.\n\nQ: What would be the TNT equivalent of a FGNW be?\nA: A 3 gram pellet of fusion fuel would release around 302 gigajoules of energy (about 72 tons of TNT), so around that.\n\nQ: How much antimatter is needed to catalyze a single FGNW?\nA: A 3 gram pellet of fusion fuel would need 1x10^11 antiprotons to catalyze nuclear fusion\n\nQ: Isn't carrying antimatter dangerous? What would happen if containment failed?\nA: The quantity of antimatter is extremely small. 1x10^11 antiprotons would release the equivalent of about 6 milligrams of TNT, that's less than a firecracker. However the energy would be released in the form of ionizing radiation so it would be a radiological hazard if containment failed.\n\nQ: Wouldn't failure of antimatter containment result in the FGNW detonating?\nA: No, nuclear fusion requires very precise injection of antimatter to catalyze fusion. Failure of containment would not result in the precise injection of antimatter to the fusion fuel. Added safety measures can be taken by separating the fusion fuel from the antimatter containment until the weapon is ready to be armed.\n\nQ: If you accidentally drop it, wouldn't containment fail?\nA: These weapons are intended to be incredibly rugged with one of their applications being bunker busters. They contain little to no moving parts and are \"full like eggs\". The FGNW report indicates that the overall ruggedness would be far superior over conventional nuclear bunker busters so no, simply dropping it wouldn't cause containment to fail.\n\nQ: Wouldn't FGNWs be  attractive for nuclear terrorism?\nA: No, it's easier to build conventional nuclear weapons. FGNWs require extremely large particle accelerators to manufacture the antimatter necessary for the FGNW. A terrorist who wants a suitcase nuke is better off with something like the M-388 Davy Crockett.\n\nQ: Are FGNW a proliferation concern?\nA: No, see above.\n\nQ: Why not make pure anti-matter weapons instead?\nA: A couple of reasons. It's prohibitively expensive. It's single handedly the most expensive substance in the world and incredibly difficult to make. Right now, if we took all the antimatter we produced and annihilate it, it would only be enough to power a lightbulb for a few hours. On the other hand, fusion fuel is incredibly cheap and abundant, you can literally make it from sea water as all it is are isotopes of hydrogen. But even if we had large quantities of antimatter, it's questionable how useful it would be as a weapon on its own. It's incredibly difficult to contain as if it touches any normal matter, it will annihilate. Containing microscopic quantities is not a problem, but macroscopic quantities are. Even if you could contain it, it would be incredibly unstable. Fusion and fission weapons fail safely, if you damage a nuclear weapon the nuclear weapon doesn't detonate. An antimatter weapon would detonate as soon as containment fails. From a cost-benefit point of view, pure antimatter weapons do not make sense.\n\nQ: Can you use conventional explosives to catalyze nuclear fusion?\nA: No. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_criterion", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M5VNnmAoIYI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M5VNnmAoIYI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M5VNnmAoIYI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "EnigmaHood", "tags": ["Nuclear Weapon (Invention)", "atomic bomb", "Atomic Bombings Of Hiroshima And Nagasaki (Disaster)", "atomic energy", "Next generation nuclear weapons", "shaped nuclear charges", "shaped nuclear weapons", "Nuclear Power (Industry)", "Edward Teller", "Space weapons", "Weapon Of Mass Destruction (Military Resource)", "WMDs", "WMD"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "4th Generation Nuclear Weapons", "description": "This is an overview of the 4th generation of nuclear weapons outlined in the report, Fourth Generation Nuclear Weapons: Military effectiveness and collateral effects, condensed into an easy to digest video. \n\nFull report click here,\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0510071v5\n\nFAQ:\nQ: In a nutshell what is a Fourth Generation Nuclear Weapon (FGNW)?\nA: It is a nuclear fusion weapon that doesn't use a fission trigger.

SECRET REVEALED", "description": "Facebook.............. https://www.facebook.com/praveenmohanfans\nInstagram................ https://instagram.com/praveenET\nTwitter...................... https://twitter.com/IamPraveenMohan\nEmail id - phenomenaltravelvideos@gmail.com\n\nThis is my Patreon account if you like to support me - https://www.patreon.com/PraveenMohan\n\nHey guys, today we are going to look at a very strange object, a jar which has magical properties. This anti-gravity jar is at least 300 years old and is displayed at the Museum of Kancheepuram in India. It looks like it has been made of wax, but it is made completely out of clay. It does not have a lid anywhere, so how do we use it? On the top it has holes, but you cannot pour water through these top holes. The only way to pour water is to hold the jar upside down, and you can see 5 holes at the bottom, and you can pour water through these holes. Now, you can see the water disappearing, but if you put the jar in an upright position, the water does not drain through the bottom holes. This is why it is called the Anti-Gravity jar. Now, notice that if the jar is kept upside down, the water is also not draining through the top holes. How did the water magically disappear? Where did the water go? The only way to get the water back is by using the spout, all the water we added through the bottom can be retrieved only  through the spout. \nThis jar is about 300 years old, but similar jars were used even 2000 years ago in India. What kind of technology was used many centuries ago, to create this magical effect? Remember, this jar is made of clay, so there is no way to put a rubber stopper or a cork inside, because when you bake this clay jar in a furnace or kiln, the rubber or cork would have turned into ashes. Also, if you shake it, there is nothing moving inside, it has no moving parts at all. \nThis jar proves that real magic and supernatural abilities existed in ancient times, this is why the jar defies the law of Gravity. Things like this exist - I have even shown you a supernatural road that defies gravity in the U S. If you drop a ball in this anti-gravity road, the ball will roll up hill, against the law of gravity. \nNow, let's see how this magic jar was really made. I have built the same model here, but I have made it on a transparent container, so you can see how it works. On the bottom of this jar, I have placed a funnel in an inverted position, and I have attached a 90 degree bend at the end of the nozzle here. So, when I invert the Jar, and pour water through these holes, the water goes through the funnel, but does not stay there and gets released into the jar. But when I put the jar back in the upright position, the water cannot get back into the funnel. The water stays around the funnel and comes back out only through the spout. This is exactly how the 300 year old Magic Jar works. Or is it?\n. \n\nSo you can see how complicated this design actually is. And why were these holes made at the top of the magic jar? Just to confuse us? No, remember this jar has no lid, without these holes, there would be no air circulation inside the jar. If someone left it with water inside, the water will have no room for evaporation without these holes, so the top holes are absolutely necessary. It shows how clever people were many centuries ago. Now, everything I have used is plastic and I am able to glue the pieces together, and I can also open the container and make changes. But the original Jar is one piece and is completely made of clay. When you bake a clay model like this in a furnace or a Kiln, the clay will expand and will get deformed. Any  slight change or just one crack inside will completely ruin the magic effect of the jar. And you can see how the jar has a shiny green glazed appearance. This color and shine has remained intact even after repeatedly using it for 300 years.  Who made these amazing jars and why?\nThese jars were made in a small village called Karigiri, this is why these jars are known as Karigiri Jars.

SECRET REVEALED", "description": "Facebook.............. https://www.facebook.com/praveenmohanfans\nInstagram................ https://instagram.com/praveenET\nTwitter...................... https://twitter.com/IamPraveenMohan\nEmail id - phenomenaltravelvideos@gmail.com\n\nThis is my Patreon account if you like to support me - https://www.patreon.com/PraveenMohan\n\nHey guys, today we are going to look at a very strange object, a jar which has magical properties. This anti-gravity jar is at least 300 years old and is displayed at the Museum of Kancheepuram in India. It looks like it has been made of wax, but it is made completely out of clay. It does not have a lid anywhere, so how do we use it? On the top it has holes, but you cannot pour water through these top holes. The only way to pour water is to hold the jar upside down, and you can see 5 holes at the bottom, and you can pour water through these holes. Now, you can see the water disappearing, but if you put the jar in an upright position, the water does not drain through the bottom holes. This is why it is called the Anti-Gravity jar. Now, notice that if the jar is kept upside down, the water is also not draining through the top holes. How did the water magically disappear? Where did the water go? The only way to get the water back is by using the spout, all the water we added through the bottom can be retrieved only  through the spout. \nThis jar is about 300 years old, but similar jars were used even 2000 years ago in India. What kind of technology was used many centuries ago, to create this magical effect? Remember, this jar is made of clay, so there is no way to put a rubber stopper or a cork inside, because when you bake this clay jar in a furnace or kiln, the rubber or cork would have turned into ashes. Also, if you shake it, there is nothing moving inside, it has no moving parts at all. \nThis jar proves that real magic and supernatural abilities existed in ancient times, this is why the jar defies the law of Gravity. Things like this exist - I have even shown you a supernatural road that defies gravity in the U S. If you drop a ball in this anti-gravity road, the ball will roll up hill, against the law of gravity. \nNow, let's see how this magic jar was really made. I have built the same model here, but I have made it on a transparent container, so you can see how it works. On the bottom of this jar, I have placed a funnel in an inverted position, and I have attached a 90 degree bend at the end of the nozzle here. So, when I invert the Jar, and pour water through these holes, the water goes through the funnel, but does not stay there and gets released into the jar. But when I put the jar back in the upright position, the water cannot get back into the funnel. The water stays around the funnel and comes back out only through the spout. This is exactly how the 300 year old Magic Jar works. Or is it?\n. \n\nSo you can see how complicated this design actually is. And why were these holes made at the top of the magic jar? Just to confuse us? No, remember this jar has no lid, without these holes, there would be no air circulation inside the jar. If someone left it with water inside, the water will have no room for evaporation without these holes, so the top holes are absolutely necessary. It shows how clever people were many centuries ago. Now, everything I have used is plastic and I am able to glue the pieces together, and I can also open the container and make changes. But the original Jar is one piece and is completely made of clay. When you bake a clay model like this in a furnace or a Kiln, the clay will expand and will get deformed. Any  slight change or just one crack inside will completely ruin the magic effect of the jar. And you can see how the jar has a shiny green glazed appearance. This color and shine has remained intact even after repeatedly using it for 300 years.  Who made these amazing jars and why?\nThese jars were made in a small village called Karigiri, this is why these jars are known as Karigiri Jars. Potters in this village,  designed many ingenious clay objects which baffled general public.  Many centuries ago, Karigiri was the center of these \"magic\" items. It is said that they built about a 100 different magic containers and each one gave a different effect. Today, these clay jars are no longer made in that village and are displayed in Museums. Out of 100 different types of magic containers, only half a dozen exist today.\n\n#Search4Truth #India #AncientAliens"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT10M49S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1980855", "likeCount": "47158", "dislikeCount": "4512", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "4733"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "iDc-eiNo8pQA9-omzxnDYZBIV2E", "id": "RqPWz4ll8Ss", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-05-04T18:34:33Z", "channelId": "UCaVp-iXRPfiSxbkhmi56IHQ", "title": "\"Ocean UNDER the Ocean\" at FULL capacity - Water has nowhere to go but UP!", "description": "May 4, 2019:         ~ Global Phenomena ~ | Water World\nhttps://www.mrmbb333.com\n\nhttps://www.citynews1130.com/video/2019/05/01/flood-waters-cresting-in-gatineau/\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/sainte-marthe-sur-le-lac-history-1.5118649\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/saskatoon-driest-april-on-record-1.5119065\n\nhttps://www.klkntv.com/story/40371142/tons-of-sand-deposited-from-historic-flooding-decimates-farmland-leaves-farmers-with-few-options?fbclid=IwAR364Iyqrzmvv9MBj61HOLgY086MZr7oYAITjhzVnrhdaYunAE5-O57xeQo\n\nhttps://kmox.radio.com/galleries/emergency-crews-st-louis-st-charles-prepare-flood-approaching-historic-1993-levels\n\nhttps://wqad.com/2019/05/02/mississippi-sets-all-time-record-worse-than-great-flood-of-93/\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/05/03/davenport-iowa-is-flooding-mississippi-river-reaches-record-levels-nearby/?utm_term=.5924a3af9a7b\n\nhttps://www.dailycomet.com/ZZ/news/20190503/flooding-missouri-waterways-close-roads-strain-levees\n\n                                                      \ud83c\udf0d\n\nIf you like my research and my daily dedication to all my loyal subscribers, and would like to show financial support, you can do so via Patreon or PayPal.

I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth \"model\" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

At its core, the documentary raises questions about the ethics and role of journalism, and the relationship between media and politics."}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H19M19S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {"ytRating": "ytAgeRestricted"}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1035785", "likeCount": "5235", "dislikeCount": "905", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "2656"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "yZaYgqsUFtl6Z5k_tmcebX-lOVY", "id": "_FHNMZbnvYU", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2014-11-11T18:15:05Z", "channelId": "UCHuLYgw4dGbC2BuZQqPWV1g", "title": "Noam Chomsky on Capitalism", "description": "Noam Chomsky on free market capitalism.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_FHNMZbnvYU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_FHNMZbnvYU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_FHNMZbnvYU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_FHNMZbnvYU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_FHNMZbnvYU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Chomsky's Philosophy", "tags": ["Socialism", "Capitalism", "Capitalist", "Market", "Markets", "Chomsky", "Noam Chomsky", "Laissez-faire", "Economics", "Economy", "Private Ownership", "Free market", "Property", "Property rights", "Philosophy", "Philosophical", "Political philosophy", "Class", "Workers", "Labor", "Equality", "Anarchism", "Income inequality", "Wealth gap", "Rich", "Poverty", "Workers' rights", "Wage slavery", "Democracy", "Propaganda", "Power"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Noam Chomsky on Capitalism", "description": "Noam Chomsky on free market capitalism."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT6M40S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "true", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "190511", "likeCount": "5521", "dislikeCount": "257", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "574"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "0ewgApzyhwQmxieZWEtsUOHOwOk", "id": "6y1zN8xJoAE", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-12-29T16:55:27Z", "channelId": "UCHuLYgw4dGbC2BuZQqPWV1g", "title": "Noam Chomsky - The Global Economy", "description": "Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y94KeniAGjg", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6y1zN8xJoAE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6y1zN8xJoAE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6y1zN8xJoAE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "Chomsky's Philosophy", "tags": ["Chomsky", "Noam Chomsky", "Iphone", "Apple Corporation", "Corporations", "Exploitation", "Capitalism", "Technology", "Profit", "Power", "Wealth gap", "Corporate", "Economy", "Economics"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Noam Chomsky - The Global Economy", "description": "Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y94KeniAGjg"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT10M40S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "29933", "likeCount": "658", "dislikeCount": "11", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "57"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "s2aBnsjPkYEU_PQ0hEXd9n7jgqs", "id": "TIPaE7FIwKs", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-11-06T01:13:19Z", "channelId": "UC0gkKMGpCgyun7OoEOseryg", "title": "Mars Germans and the Secret Space Program - ROBERT SEPEHR", "description": "While the idea of anti-gravity space flight, or a breakaway German colony on the Moon, or a subterranean UFO base in Antarctica, might all sound like science fiction, what can be said for certain is that they are not new ideas, nor do not seem to be easily explained away.

Why, they haunt still shores or stayed beached on dry land as they slowly rust and erode. Here are some of the most famous shipwrecks where they ended up.\n\n\nSubscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr\n\n \n\n10. Sleeping Bear\n The shipwrecks found beneath the water\u2019s surface in Sleeping Bear on located near the Lower Peninsula of Lake MIchigan. A famous ship found here was the Francisco Morazan, which sailed off from the city of Chicago back in 1960. There was over 940 tons of cargo when it was met with fog and snow, which proved too much for the ship. In the end, it was abandoned by the next month, which left the ship to just sink and rust into the lake waters since the owners of the ship were never found and there was no one to deal with the removal of it from the water.\n\n \n \n9. Land\u00e9vennec \n This ship yard is located along the Aulne River in north west France. Most of the ships seen here are military vessels near Pen Forn. The mountains surrounding the waters not only help it the site from being an eyesore, but their presence apparently help keep the water calm, ultimately making for a smoother decomposition of the old ships to disintegrate better.\n\n  \n \n8. Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky\n On the shores of this Russian town are lines of old submarines that sit decomposing in the water. These abandoned submarines are partially sunk in the water as they just await to rust. No one is sure just how many submarines can be found in these waters, nor is much else known about their condition or purpose.\n\n \n \n \n7. Bikini Atoll\n Bikini Atoll is known as being a nuclear testing site, and it\u2019s also a location where ships have sunk, creating an old shipyard site for the old sea vessels. The ships were part of atomic tests during the 1940s, one such being the USS Independence. Not only that, but there\u2019s aid to be over 55 gallons of radioactive waste in drums dumped here as well. The USS Saratoga lies here as well, with a lot of the vessels found here having been forgotten about.\n\n \n\n \n \n6. Sha\u2019b Abu Nuhas\n In the depths of the Red Sea is a location referred to as the Wrecks of Abu Nuhas. It is the site of at least 7 shipwrecks that lie near the triangle shaped coral reef near the north western part of Shadwan Island. Of the ships were is the SS Carnatic, Olden, Kimon M, and as seen pictured here, The Giannis D. Divers come here all the time to check out the metal ruins of old ships that have met their demise in the open waters. Along with the rusted metal is a diverse amount of wildlife that also makes it a popular diving site.\n\n \n \n \n \n5. Jervois Basin\n This body of water is seen an unfit for swimming, but that doesn\u2019t stop people from checking out the wrecks found at the Jervois Basin in South Australia near the upper region of Port Adelaide River. Here you can see the skeletal remains of old ships in the process of ship breaking. It\u2019s not the active ship breaking yard it once ways, and remnants of that part of history can still be seen here.\n \n \n \n4. Curtin Artificial Reef \n It is one of the largest Reef Projects in the world and has been a site of wrecked sea vessels since 1968. Since then there have been over 32 ships, buoys, cars, and other pieces of vehicles and vessels that have been allowed to sink and become part of the reef. This shipwreck in Australia was established by the Underwater Research Group of Queensland and is a project that has attracted much more marine life to the waters.\n\n \n  \n \n3. Aral Sea\n  The dry sand pictured here would be the last place you think you\u2019d see so many ships come together as they sit all run down in the sun, and yet the ships on the Aral Sea are some of the most prominent and famous in the world. Located in a basin in the border of the countries of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, the shipwrecks of the Aral Sea have been a strange sight to behold ever since the level of the sea started to rapidly decline by the 1960s. \n \n \n2. Skeleton Coast\n If these skull and crossbones gates are anything to go by, it the fact that Skeleton Coast in Namibia are one of the most well known shipwrecks in the world.

Why, they haunt still shores or stayed beached on dry land as they slowly rust and erode. Here are some of the most famous shipwrecks where they ended up.\n\n\nSubscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr\n\n \n\n10. Sleeping Bear\n The shipwrecks found beneath the water\u2019s surface in Sleeping Bear on located near the Lower Peninsula of Lake MIchigan. A famous ship found here was the Francisco Morazan, which sailed off from the city of Chicago back in 1960. There was over 940 tons of cargo when it was met with fog and snow, which proved too much for the ship. In the end, it was abandoned by the next month, which left the ship to just sink and rust into the lake waters since the owners of the ship were never found and there was no one to deal with the removal of it from the water.\n\n \n \n9. Land\u00e9vennec \n This ship yard is located along the Aulne River in north west France. Most of the ships seen here are military vessels near Pen Forn. The mountains surrounding the waters not only help it the site from being an eyesore, but their presence apparently help keep the water calm, ultimately making for a smoother decomposition of the old ships to disintegrate better.\n\n  \n \n8. Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky\n On the shores of this Russian town are lines of old submarines that sit decomposing in the water. These abandoned submarines are partially sunk in the water as they just await to rust. No one is sure just how many submarines can be found in these waters, nor is much else known about their condition or purpose.\n\n \n \n \n7. Bikini Atoll\n Bikini Atoll is known as being a nuclear testing site, and it\u2019s also a location where ships have sunk, creating an old shipyard site for the old sea vessels. The ships were part of atomic tests during the 1940s, one such being the USS Independence. Not only that, but there\u2019s aid to be over 55 gallons of radioactive waste in drums dumped here as well. The USS Saratoga lies here as well, with a lot of the vessels found here having been forgotten about.\n\n \n\n \n \n6. Sha\u2019b Abu Nuhas\n In the depths of the Red Sea is a location referred to as the Wrecks of Abu Nuhas. It is the site of at least 7 shipwrecks that lie near the triangle shaped coral reef near the north western part of Shadwan Island. Of the ships were is the SS Carnatic, Olden, Kimon M, and as seen pictured here, The Giannis D. Divers come here all the time to check out the metal ruins of old ships that have met their demise in the open waters. Along with the rusted metal is a diverse amount of wildlife that also makes it a popular diving site.\n\n \n \n \n \n5. Jervois Basin\n This body of water is seen an unfit for swimming, but that doesn\u2019t stop people from checking out the wrecks found at the Jervois Basin in South Australia near the upper region of Port Adelaide River. Here you can see the skeletal remains of old ships in the process of ship breaking. It\u2019s not the active ship breaking yard it once ways, and remnants of that part of history can still be seen here.\n \n \n \n4. Curtin Artificial Reef \n It is one of the largest Reef Projects in the world and has been a site of wrecked sea vessels since 1968. Since then there have been over 32 ships, buoys, cars, and other pieces of vehicles and vessels that have been allowed to sink and become part of the reef. This shipwreck in Australia was established by the Underwater Research Group of Queensland and is a project that has attracted much more marine life to the waters.\n\n \n  \n \n3. Aral Sea\n  The dry sand pictured here would be the last place you think you\u2019d see so many ships come together as they sit all run down in the sun, and yet the ships on the Aral Sea are some of the most prominent and famous in the world. Located in a basin in the border of the countries of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, the shipwrecks of the Aral Sea have been a strange sight to behold ever since the level of the sea started to rapidly decline by the 1960s. \n \n \n2. Skeleton Coast\n If these skull and crossbones gates are anything to go by, it the fact that Skeleton Coast in Namibia are one of the most well known shipwrecks in the world. Skeleton Coast is found along the coast of Namibia along a coast that touches that Atlantic Ocean. Rusted ships have been beached here, the environment rusting and breaking them down to seem like skeletal  formations along the beach.\n\n \nGadani\n This is one of the top 3 largest ship breaking yards in the world and is still one of the most active. Gadani, located 50 miles northwest of Karachi, Pakistan, is a yard that is the location of 132 ship breaking plots. A few decades ago, it was the largest ship breaking yard in the world, and even now that it has been surpassed on that front, it is still one of the most well known and leads the world in its ship breaking efficiency."}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT10M36S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1565963", "likeCount": "4672", "dislikeCount": "946", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "725"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "EG4gEgSUbEqsg9_aaRF17cqdU58", "id": "1tZs02kxTdg", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-08-15T19:13:58Z", "channelId": "UCogrSQkBJn1KF0N9I4oM7eQ", "title": "What Are the Van Allen Belts?

For example, the GDP per person rose by 760 percent, life expectancy improved from 55 to 79 years, and various other automotive, technological, medical, and quality-of-life advances were achieved.\n\nRobinson then starts the discussion with former secretary of state George Shultz, who encourages a broader vision as we look for the reasons for prosperity. Shultz discusses some of the major events that occurred during the 20th century, e.g., the Great Depression, currency manipulation, World War II, and the Holocaust, whose negative impacts framed the mindset of Americans to question the institutions underlying society. Robinson then asks John Cogan about these institutions\u2014private property, the rule of law, free markets\u2014and the importance of these for prosperity. Cogan explains those institutions are necessary for sustained prosperity, which demands conditions that are stable in order to fuel economic growth.\n\nRobinson asks Terry Anderson about the importance of property rights. Terry says that property rights are the key to providing people with incentives to care for and maintain the property they own. Anderson notes that nobody washes rental cars, because they don\u2019t own them.\n\nRobinson asks Lee Ohanian about the role of immigration in prosperity. Ohanian says that the United States has been fortunate in attracting the best talents from all over the world, which has played a major role in sustaining prosperity. Ohanian notes that having an inflow of immigrants like Sergey Brin from Soviet Union, Elon Musk from South Africa, and others has helped the United States stay on the cutting edge of innovation with new and fresh ideas.\n\nFor further information: \nhttps://www.hoover.org/publications/uncommon-knowledge\n\nInterested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

William Engdahl is this straight forward hard-talk interview, filmed at the Open Mind Conference in Skanderborg, Denmark in September 2013. \n\nBiography of F. William Engdahl courtesy of:  http://.www.williamengdahl.com:\n\n\"F. William Engdahl has been researching and writing about the world political scene for more than thirty years. His various books on geopolitics\u2014the interaction between international power politics, economics and geography\u2014have been translated into 14 foreign languages from Chinese to French, from German to Japanese.\n\nHis most recent works trace the strategies and events that led to the rise of the US as an international superpower. He describes the emergence after 1945 of an American power as a new kind of Empire not based upon sole military occupation of land, but control of vital resources. Domination was through creation of an informal empire where control of finance, of the basic food chain, of energy\u2014above all of oil, would be the basis for what would become the greatest concentration of power in history, an American Sole Superpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nBorn in Minnesota, William Engdahl grew up in Texas. After earning a degree in politics from Princeton University, and graduate study in comparative economics at Stockholm University, he worked as an economist and investigative freelance journalist in New York and Europe.\n\nHe has lectured on contemporary geopolitics as Visiting Professor at Beijing University of Chemical Technology and delivers talks and private seminars around the world on different aspects of economics and politics with focus on political risk. He has given talks at the Ministry of Science and Technology Conference on Alternative Energy, Beijing; London Centre for Energy Policy Studies of Hon. Sheikh Zaki Yamani; Turkish-Eurasian Business Council of Istanbul, Global Investors' Forum (GIF) Montreaux Switzerland; Bank Negara Indonesia; the Russian Institute of Strategic Studies; the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Croatian Chamber of Commerce and Economics.\n\nF. William Engdahl also contributes regularly to a number of international publications on economics and political affairs including Asia Times, FinancialSense.com, 321.gold.com, The Real News, RT.com OpEdge, RT TV, Asia Inc., GlobalResearch.com, Japan's Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Foresight magazine. He has been a frequent contributor to the New York Grant'sInvestor.com, European Banker and Business Banker International, Globus in Croatia, and has been interviewed on various geopolitical topics on numerous international TV and radio programs including USA Coast-to-Coast with George Noory, Al Jazeera, CCTV and Sina.com (China), Korea Broadcasting System (KBS), and Channel 1 Russian TV.\n\nWilliam is a Research Associate of Michel Chossudovsky's Centre for Research on Globalization in Montreal, Canada and member of the editorial board of Eurasia magazine. He currently lives in Germany and in addition to writing and giving interviews on current events, consults as a political risk economist for various private organizations, major European banks and private investor groups.

But there have been no such concessions from anyone regarding Flight 990, and after nearly 20 years, there is no resolution for the bereaved families, not least that of First Officer Gameel al-Batouti.\n\n- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe \n- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish \n- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera \n- Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/\n\n#AlJazeeraEnglish #Flight990 #AlJazeeraWorld"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT45M54S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "72447", "likeCount": "436", "dislikeCount": "79", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "284"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "4QseTylGc_mEri3Z5kXce-Ph27Y", "id": "87HTRliaxZk", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-04-07T14:00:01Z", "channelId": "UCbLo9Rad_4G0UCRqjqRm9qA", "title": "Doctors Share DUMBEST \"r/IAMVERYSMART\" Patients", "description": "Doctors of reddit, what was your dumbest r/iamverysmart patient experience? r/askreddit", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87HTRliaxZk/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87HTRliaxZk/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87HTRliaxZk/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87HTRliaxZk/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87HTRliaxZk/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "TZ Entertainment", "tags": ["Doctors of reddit", "doctors share", "r/iamverysmart", "askreddit doctors", "comment awards reddit", "brainydude reddit", "reddit & chill", "reddit and chill", "best of askreddit", "top posts of all time", "dankify reddit", "tz reddit", "r/", "top posts"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Doctors Share DUMBEST \"r/IAMVERYSMART\" Patients", "description": "Doctors of reddit, what was your dumbest r/iamverysmart patient experience? r/askreddit"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT11M2S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "761103", "likeCount": "13355", "dislikeCount": "515", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "2213"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "I8LW0rlaxaUHPWstKOG31oiA0iI", "id": "Yi-axQLbFLY", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-04-04T18:43:30Z", "channelId": "UCqlYzSgsh5jdtWYfVIBoTDw", "title": "Dean Cain Blasts Hollywood 'Bullies' for Threatening Boycott of GA Over 'Heartbeat' Bill", "description": "Actor Dean Cain called out Hollywood \"bullies\" after dozens of TV and film workers threatened to boycott working in Georgia if a controversial abortion bill is signed into law in the state.\n\nMORE: https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/04/04/dean-cain-alyssa-milano-hollywood-celebrities-bullying-georgia-over-heartbeat-abortion", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yi-axQLbFLY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yi-axQLbFLY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yi-axQLbFLY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yi-axQLbFLY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yi-axQLbFLY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Fox News Insider", "tags": ["Dean Cain", "Fox & Friends", "Georgia", "abortion", "Hollywood", "Alyssa Milano"], "categoryId": "25", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Dean Cain Blasts Hollywood 'Bullies' for Threatening Boycott of GA Over 'Heartbeat' Bill", "description": "Actor Dean Cain called out Hollywood \"bullies\" after dozens of TV and film workers threatened to boycott working in Georgia if a controversial abortion bill is signed into law in the state.\n\nMORE: https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/04/04/dean-cain-alyssa-milano-hollywood-celebrities-bullying-georgia-over-heartbeat-abortion"}}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT5M19S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "111884", "likeCount": "2720", "dislikeCount": "75", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1182"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "iN1oF5vqZNLXy9nL1HyzNSOZCEQ", "id": "dGHY6nbd3_g", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2019-01-29T20:07:32Z", "channelId": "UCjNxszyFPasDdRoD9J6X-sw", "title": "Mark Levin Worships Wealth, Spits on Commie Cortez", "description": "SUPPORT THE CHANNELS \n\u2705Paypal -

Weekend with Some Australian Dudes\nEverybody loves Australia. They are the Earth\u2019s beauty mark. The people are boisterous and sometimes a little weirdly specific type of racist. A group of Australian guys sold a weekend hanging out with them, and it went for 1,300. They promised beers, snacks, and a lot of laughs. Not sure if laughs include sexual favors but, it\u2019s not as they could advertise it.\n\n8. Britney Spears Gum\nNo, she isn\u2019t releasing a new line of chewing gum. The item for sale was a chewed piece of gum that she had spat out at one of her concerts. It was sold in 2000 for 14,000. No wonder Britney had a breakdown. People are nuts. \n\n7. Imaginary Friends\nThere has actually been more than one imaginary friend that was sold on eBay. Some of them are doing for therapeutic reasons, and some of them are just doing it for the cold hard cash. The price for these non-existent items has been sold successfully for anywhere from 100 to 6000 dollars. The more creative, the better. The people who are buying these items are most likely just children with their parent's credit cards, right?\n\n6. Justin Timberlake\u2019s Half Eaten Toast\nThe listing was done after a half eaten piece of french toast was found in Justin Timberlake\u2019s dressing room after he did an interview at a radio station. The toast was eventually sold for 1025 to a die hard fan of the singer. \n\n5. Box of Twinkies\nTwinkies are one of those snacks that are undeniably American. There was also a scare in 2012 when Hostess announced that it was closing due to bankruptcy.  This caused a frenzy that left many people furiously buying as many Hostess products as was possible like it was the apocalypse. The frenzy led to a box of 10 Twinkies to sell for 59.99, a product that would usually cost about 2 to 3 dollars at a grocery store. Of course, hostess started production again not long after that making everyone feel a little bit silly. The buyer can now say that he has the most expensive box of Twinkies ever, though. If they don't release a gold plated Twinkie at some point.\n\n4. Virgin Mary Grilled Cheese\nThis grilled cheese is worth more than most people's cars. It is believed to depict the Virgin Mary who is a prominent figure in Christianity. The sandwich was a decade old at the time that it was sold for 28,000. The purchaser was an internet casino that purchased the sandwich, not for religious reasons but because they wanted to take it on tour. The casino wanted to take the sandwich on tour and donate the proceeds to charity. If somebody didn\u2019t eat it to absorb its power like a vampire, then that is just a waste of a magic sandwich.\n\n3. Virginity\nRosie Reid was one of the first people to attempt to auction off her virginity on ebay. There are actually an alarmingly high case of attempts. Rosie Reid is the only case that has claimed to have actually been completed. She needed the money to help pay for school tuition and actually specified in the ad that she is actually a lesbian. She was reported to have been sold for 11,000 and luckily, the man who bought her virginity never claimed it. He just wanted to help her pay for school.\n\n2. Forehead Ad Space\nAndrew Fischer had the enterprising idea to auction off space on his forehead that he would put a company's logo on. The tattoo had to be non-permanent though, and he would only wear it for 30 days. The news coverage from the circus would be more than enough advertisement than some guys forehead but, his forehead still sold for 37,375. The company that won was a snoring remedy called SnoreStop. We hope that their sales went up at least.\n\n1.A Life\nNo, this wasn\u2019t done in some seedy basement with Hip to be Square playing on repeat and billionaire's bidding on who gets to kill him. Ian Usher sold his life on eBay, and the sale included all of his Earthly belongings, his friends, and even his job. The ad was brought on by a divorce and the desire to start over. In the end, his life went for 300,000, and he got more out of the sale. He has written several books since the sell and Disney is planning to adapt his story into a movie.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rRDKv_VGJik/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rRDKv_VGJik/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rRDKv_VGJik/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "Bored Badger", "tags": ["unbelievable", "things", "sold", "ebay", "won't believe", "strangest", "weirdest", "bizarre", "most", "top", "list", "bought", "ever", "people", "funny", "facts", "buy", "actually", "shocking", "real", "unusual", "wtf", "true", "Justin Bieber", "hair", "money", "Pharrell", "hat", "Dorito", "Britney Spears", "pregnancy test", "guinea pig armor", "ghost", "haunted", "town", "imaginary friends", "Justin Timberlake", "expensive", "virginity", "strangest things ever sold on ebay", "weirdest things ever sold on ebay!", "bizarre things posted for sale on ebay"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "18 Unbelievable Things Sold On Ebay", "description": "You won't believe the strange things that people actually bought off of Ebay like Britney Spear's pregnancy test and Pharrell's weird hat. \n\n9.

This tent features a mirage drive pedal-crank mechanism and comes complete with paddles to help assist maneuvering the boat down most bodies of water with ease. Detachable folding seats allow for a spacious, comfy interior when converted to a tent. The outrigger promises to easily fit all of your camping gear and a screen cloth mounts between the bars of the boat to serve as a base for the tent. Finally a houseboat for the masses! Now you can catch your fishy dinner, cook it and eat it all while drifting beneath the stars, or paddle yourself to shore and be ready to continue your journey whenever the mood strikes you. Online the item appears to be sold out, but hopefully more will be made available soon, so keep checking the interwebs for your chance to own this ultra cool kayak tent.   \n\n3 - I-Gloobox\nMarketed as a vagabond's luxury street home these cuddly warm shelters were designed with the homeless in mind. Each pocket promises to be cozy, warm on cold nights and easy to maintain as well as put together. The shape is reminiscent of an igloo, hence the namesake, it's motto on the website states, practically perfect. Manufactured from thick, waterproof materials, each panel of this crazy cool tent can be easily replaced and is designed to be used as storage, which both strengthens the interior of the structure as well as helps provide insulation. Every single pocket-sized tile of this tent can be replaced with another waterproof tile of the same size, the pieces are held together with sticking bands and folding plastic which fit intricately inside the folding aluminum frame. And the I-Gloobox even comes complete with wheels making transporting your home away from home super simple. Searching online this tent may still be in production as a price has yet to be available.  \n\n2 - Cocoon\nThe website for this treetop skybox tent from the future promises this is the new glamping way of sleeping in nature. This cocoon tree bed which comfortably holds a complete double bed interior is said to be: resistant to the wind, waterproof, easy to assemble (approximately only three hours by three persons), safe as there are six separate anchor points of suspension and six more for lateral stability, long lasting aluminum structuring, and four stand-alone feet to offer the advantage of a raised tent. This advantage of height allows the benefit that most camp crashing critters won't find their way inside at night. And when you remove the cocoon tree from its site, there are no lasting adverse effects on the trees or surrounding nature, perfect for any leave no trace event. This high quality three meters all around structure allows for 2.3 tons of weight. Sadly this beauty of luxury camping is only available through a few retailers overseas, so the typical cost is roughly 8,000 dollars US. \n\n1 - Pod Tents\nDo you enjoy camping? Do you have friends who enjoy camping? Do you enjoy camping with your friends? Well, then this modular tent connection system might be the ideal choice for your next grand adventure. This innovation in tent technology hails from a United Kingdom company which is focused on improving the social aspect of camping, as well as turning small tents into genuine multi-roomed dwellings. With this tent system, socializing doesn't have to stop at night or in bad weather scenarios. For this camping made fun of the future system, individual pods that are connected with tunnels promise to provide variety and flexibility when it comes to configuration and setup. So far there are two models, the eight-sided maxi model, with room for eight people, and the six-sided mini model, which allows for four people to share the spaces comfortably. The mini comes with an internal splitting cell which divides the space into two separate sleeping compartments, the option is available in the larger size as well but costs extra as an add-on option. The mini unit goes for around 625 dollars American, while the Maxi sells for about 780 bucks US.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OiByM3iyHrg/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OiByM3iyHrg/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OiByM3iyHrg/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "Talltanic", "tags": ["Talltanic", "Amazing", "innovative", "camping", "tents", "travel", "glamping", "tent", "camp", "outdoor", "vacation", "outdoorsy", "environmental", "sustainable", "outdoors", "incredible", "products", "crazy", "cool", "solar", "bubble", "bubble tent", "solar tent", "kayak", "treehouse", "tree house", "pod", "pod tent", "innovation", "awesome", "new inventions", "glamp", "coolest", "coolest tents you must see", "amazing camping innovations", "book tent", "tech", "features", "awesome inventions", "cork tent", "amazing innovative camping tents"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "AMAZING Innovative Camping Tents", "description": "If you are an outdoor person who loves camping out but has grown bored of the standard Walmart tent; if you are an avid lover of festivals and want a chance to enjoy your concert in optimum comfort; if you and your family enjoy getting out of the big city and are sick of your tent leaking and the overall lack of comfortability; then here are some of the newest, coolest, creatively innovative tents on or about to hit the market. \n\nSubscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr  \n\n4 - The Kahuna Kayak Tent\nFrom the Yanko Design team, this tent is perfect for your next camping trip to the lake, as this open-top outrigger kayak easily converts into a tent.
